# Textbook Editing Instructions

**Context**
I am writing a textbook on image systems engineering for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. The book is being written using Quarto markdown. This repository contains the book chapters and figures.

**Priorities**
1. **Accuracy and Clarity**: These are the most important attributes.
2. **Tone**: Interesting, welcoming, and not intimidating.
3. **Brevity**: Not wordy. Brief, friendly, and to the point when possible.

**Audience**
Advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.
