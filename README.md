# Foundations of Image Systems Engineering
Draft of a book on Image Systems Engineering, based on my Stanford class with Joyce Farrell (Psych 221)

We are starting to write this book in Quarto from POSIT. 

This repository contains the static chapters and control files (yaml) needed to assemble the book.

I will start putting the png files iin the images directory, organized by chapter.

I will start putting the bib file in a references directory.

The model repository we are starting from is the one for Michael Frank's book.  He has been a resource.
