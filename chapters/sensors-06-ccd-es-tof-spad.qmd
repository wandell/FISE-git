Curved sensor projects

Finally, it is possible to reduce spherical aberration by changing the imaging surface. An image system that couples a spherical lens with an appropriately curved sensor can have very small spherical aberration. This idea is partly inspired by the fact that the retina in many animals lines the interior of the eyeball, forming a curved sensor surface. While this is not widely used, there have been several projects to create sensors on bendable materials, including some very expensive research projects. The idea is to build these sensors for cameras with very large field of view and very high resolution across the field of view.
