# System characterization {#sec-sensors-characterization}
When we characterize a system, it is with respect to some kind of model of how the system operates.  ISETCam has such a model.  We open by describing the basic model of the image sensor, and then illustrate how to make measurements to characterize the sensor, thus filling in parameters of the model.

## System modeling {#sensor-system-modeling}
Standard sensor designs are effective for many uses, which is why they are produced in large quantities. However, they have limitations: color filters can reduce sensitivity and restrict spectral information, while circuit elements can introduce noise or limit dynamic range and speed. These challenges have driven innovations in sensor and pixel design, especially for applications beyond traditional photography. Later sections will explore advanced pixel architectures, new materials, and on-chip processing techniques that address these issues. As this book is online, sections about these advances can be updated as new technologies emerge as well as links to additional resources.

Quantization.  Noise.  Use Abbas' class notes and modeling in ISETCam.

## Spatial sensitivity (ISO 12233)

## Color calibration
Does this need to be put off until after color is introduced?


## ARVS mobile photography article

I was reading @delbracio-mobile-2021 and it surprised me how it glossed over various claims. For example, a small sensor was deemed to be worse than a big sensor without reference to pixel size. The notion that one had to apply gain and thus multiply the noise without considering the light level or pixel size. No mention of well capacity.

Probably some of this stuff is true, some is false, but the whole article doesn't explain the way we should do here. Also, this kind of vague stuff:

3.2.7. Tone mapping. A tone map is a 1D LUT that is applied per color channel to adjust the tonal values of the image. Figure 10 shows an example. Tone mapping serves two purposes. First, combined with color manipulation, it adjusts the image’s aesthetic appeal, often by increasing the contrast. Second, the final output image is usually only 8 to 10 bits per channel (i.e., 256 or 1,024 tonal values), while the raw-RGB sensor represents a pixel’s digital value using 10–14 bits (i.e., 1,024 up to 16,384 tonal values). As a result, it is necessary to compress the tonal values from the wider tonal range to a tighter range via tone mapping. This adjustment is reminiscent of the human eye’s adaptation to scene brightness (Land 1974). Figure 11 shows a typical 1D LUT used for tone mapping.
