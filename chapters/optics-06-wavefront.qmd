# Wavefront optics {#sec-optics-wavefront}
ISETCam uses wavefront representations.  Continuity.

## Wavefronts and images
Look for an explanation of why the wavefront at the lens is related to the image irradiance by a Fourier Transform.  Goodman?  ChatGPT?  Come on, it must be out there.

Lead up to wavefront in the next section.

## Wavefront aberrations
Zernike polynomials.

Explain the Zernike polynomials as an approximation to the wavefront.  Born and Wolf description of derivation might be good here.

## Apodization function 
Pupil shape can get introduced here.
