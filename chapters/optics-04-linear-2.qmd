# Harmonics {#sec-optics-harmonics}

We should probably start by talking about the term harmonic.  For real valued functions, it just means sin and cos functions, which are really the same except for a shift in position.  The harmonics are the sin, cos, and all the shifted versions in between.

Do we start by noticing that the sum of two harmonics of the same frequency is a harmonic of the same frequency?

## Eigenfunctions - almost

Harmonics (like sine and cosine waves) are almost the “natural” patterns for linear systems—they’re close to being eigenfunctions. For imaging, they’re not quite perfect eigenfunctions because of phase shifts, but if you think of them as 2D vectors, they’re pretty close.
