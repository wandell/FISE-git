# Optical transfer functions {#sec-optical-transfer}
It is easy to think of images as a set of points. It is an important insight, however, to realize that an image can be described in other ways. Some of these alternative image representations are valuable for analyzing optical performance in an the image system.

An important general approach for creating alternative representations is to linear models. We introduced linear models in @sec-linear-models, and we applied them to characterizing the spectral properties of light fields. Here we will be using linear models again, but in a different way.  In this case we create linear models of the image intensity spatial distribution, $I(x,y)$. The model will be useful for characterizing the properties of an optical system. 

A general linear model of the image intensity can be written this way:

$$
I(x,y) = \sum_{i} w_{i} B_{i}(x,y)
$$

The functions $B_{i}(x,y)$ are the **spatial basis functions**, and the scalar values $w_{i,j}$ are the weights. The model represents the image as the weighted sum of these basis functions. In general, but not always, we select basis functions that are orthogonal to one another, 

$$
0 = \sum_{x,y} B_i (x,y) B_j (x,y).
$$ {eq-spatial-orthogonal}

These models are also called an **image decompositions**, because we consider the linear model as decomposing the original image into these basis functions. Linear models important in image systems, and they are important in science and engineering broadly. Of all the linear models, the decomposition into the weighted sum of harmonic functions has been the most important. 

## Harmonics {#sec-optics-harmonics}
For real-valued signals - such as light intensity - the harmonic functions are the *Sine* and *Cosine*. In typical use, *Sine* and *Cosine* are one-dimensional functions.  But in image systems applications we express them as two-dimensional images

$$
I(x,y) = M(1 + A sin(2\pi f_x x + \phi_x + 2 \pi f_y y + \ phi_y)) .
$${#eq-harmonics-2d}

Th harmonic image has a mean of $M$ and a **contrast** of $A$. Because image intensities are always positive, any realizable image must have the value of $A$ be within the range $[-1 1]$. @fig-optics-harmonics-2d shows four examples of **image harmonics**, each with a different pair of frequencies $f_x$ and $f_y$.

![What's an image harmonic, you say? And why is this a good idea?](images/optics/optics-harmonics.png){#fig-optics-harmonics-2d width="100%"}

We can develop many of the principles of linear models using one-dimensional harmonic images. @fig-optics-harmonics-1d shows a set of spatial harmonics with different spatial frequencies $f_x$, $f_y = 0$ and a range of contrasts $A$. 

![These are all of the form ${a_0}/2 + a_f sin(2 \pi f x + \phi_f)$, but with $\phi_f = 0$ and $a_f$ varying from $1, 0.5 \text{ to } 0.1$.](images/optics/optics-harmonics-1d.png){#fig-optics-harmonics-1d width="100%"}

### Fourier series
It is was surprising for mathematicians to learn that the weighted sum of harmonics can represent measurable functions. Each of the individual harmonics is periodic and spans the entire image width; how could the sum of these harmonics be equal to the image of something as compact as a thin line?  

For example, here I am adding up a series of this images at different frequencies.  Notice that the result becomes increasingly compact so that after a while adding these very extended images produces a single line!

There is a second way to think about the optical transformations. Rather than measure how the optics transforms points at different depths and visual field positions, we measure how the system transforms

**Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier** had the important insight we can express most realistic functions -such as a 1-dimensional light pattern $I(x)$- as the weighted sum of harmonics. We write this idea as the **Fourier series**. 

$$
I(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_f s_f \sin(2 \pi f x ) + c_f \cos(2 \pi f x)
$$ {#eq-fourier-series}

The first term, $\frac{a_0}{2}$, is the mean of the signal $I(x)$. For each frequency, $f$, there are two coefficients: the amplitudes $s_f$ and $c_f$. These terms represent the modulation of the signal around the mean.

Another way to write the Fourier series is to use only one type of harmonic, say the Sine, but to include a frequency-dependent phase. 

$$
I(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_f a_f \sin(2 \pi f x + \phi_f)
$$ {#eq-fourier-series-phase}

In this form, the equation also has two parameters, an amplitude $s_f$ and phase $\phi_f$. The parameters these two representations are related by 

$$
\begin{align}
a_f & = \sqrt{{s_f}^2 + {c_f}^2} \\
\phi_f & = \arctan(\frac{c_f}{s_f})
\end{align}
$$

### Fourier series coefficients

The coefficients of the series are computed using the following integrals:

- Constant (mean) term:

  $$
  a_0 = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \, dx
  $$

- Cosine (even) coefficients:

  $$
  a_f = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(2 \pi f x) \, dx
  $$

- Sine (odd) coefficients:

  $$
  b_f = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \sin(2 \pi f x) \, dx
  $$

The coefficient $a_0$ in the Fourier series is **twice** the average (mean) value of the function over the interval.

$$
\text{Mean of } f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\, dx = \frac{a_0}{2}
$$

And that is why it appears divided by 2.

Something about his story and the challenge of getting his work published.

Maybe the criticism of his work.

## Eigenfunctions - almost

Harmonics (like sine and cosine waves) are almost the “natural” patterns for linear systems—they’re close to being eigenfunctions. For imaging, they’re not quite perfect eigenfunctions because of phase shifts, but if you think of them as 2D vectors, they’re pretty close.
