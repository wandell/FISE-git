# Circuits {#sec-sensors-circuits}

CMOS image sensors use a photodiode—and the photoelectric effect—to measure and store the optical light field at the sensor surface. The key technical breakthrough that enabled CMOS sensors was the integration of circuitry that stores and transmits the accumulated charge (number of electrons) from the photodiode to the computer. We can think of the photodiode and its local circuitry as a pixel. The logical flow of the circuitry is as follows:

-   Before image capture, the circuitry resets each pixel to clear any residual charge from previous exposures.
-   During image acquisition, the photodiode array collects electrons generated by incoming light; these electrons are stored within the photodiode or in a nearby capacitor.
-   During readout, the circuitry transfers the stored charge to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), where it is converted to a digital value.
-   The resulting digital image array records the amount of light captured by each pixel.

CMOS circuitry is the main focus of this section (@sec-sensors-circuits). Most CMOS image sensors also include essential components such as color filter arrays and microlenses, which redirect light from the main lens onto each photodiode within the pixel. The following sections introduce these components and demonstrate how to simulate sensor performance. Section @sec-sensors-modeling uses ISETCam to model sensor performance, from the scene light field to image capture.

## 3T circuitry

The original CMOS pixel design uses a three-transistor (3T) circuit to store and read out the charge collected by the photodiode (@fig-sensor). Each pixel contains three key transistors: $M_{rst}$ (reset), $M_{sel}$ (select), and $M_{sf}$ (source follower). The $M_{rst}$ transistor resets the photodiode by connecting it to the supply voltage (Vdd), clearing any residual charge before image capture. The $M_{sel}$ transistor selects a specific row of pixels, connecting them to the readout circuitry. The $M_{sf}$ transistor acts as a buffer, transferring the stored charge to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for measurement. In most sensors, each column has its own ADC, but some designs use a single ADC shared among multiple columns—a technique known as multiplexing (mux).

Ideally, the photodiode’s response to light is linear, with the number of generated electrons following Poisson statistics. However, the surrounding circuitry introduces additional sources of noise and nonlinearity. For example, the storage capacitor has a limited capacity, so it can saturate at high light levels. The transistors used for readout can also introduce noise and small nonlinearities. Furthermore, variations in pixel properties across the sensor array can cause fixed-pattern noise. In modern CMOS sensors, these nonlinearities and noise sources are typically small—on the order of a few percent @Wang2017-CMOSLinearity—but they can still affect image quality. Careful characterization and calibration are necessary to minimize these effects and produce high-quality images.

## 4T circuitry

Since around 2000, the three-transistor (3T) pixel design has been largely replaced by the four-transistor (4T) pixel circuit [@Fossum2014-pinnedpd]. The 4T architecture introduces a pinned photodiode (PPD) and adds a transfer gate transistor (@fig-sensor-4T-circuit). The transfer gate moves the accumulated photo-generated charge from the photodiode to a nearby storage node called the floating diffusion, which is associated with a capacitance denoted $C_{fd}$. The reset, row select, and source follower circuit elements are still in place.

The addition of the transfer gate and floating diffusion enables more precise control over charge transfer and storage within each pixel.

Today, the 4T pixel is standard in nearly all high-performance CMOS image sensors, including those used in smartphones, machine vision, automotive systems, and scientific imaging.

When activated, the new transistor transfers the accumulated charge from the photodiode to a storage capacitor (the floating diffusion node, $C_{fd}$). The rest of the circuit, including readout and row select, is similar to the 3T design.](images/sensors/03-4T-circuit.png){#fig-sensor-4T-circuit}


<!--
There is also Theuwissen diagram, with five transistors that he calls a 4T circuit.  In the paper 'Linearity analysis ...' @Wang2017-CMOSLinearity.  He says the source follower is shared by multiple rows of pixels. It is Figure 2.  

The text: "Figure 2 shows the schematic of a typical voltage mode 4T pixel. The pixel circuit consists of a pinned photodiode, a charge
transfer switch (M1), a reset switch (M2), a source follower (M3) and a row select switch (M4). The current source transistor (M5) is shared by multiple rows of pixels. VDD is the power supply while VPIX is the output voltage of pixel. VLN provides an adjustable bias current. In the following analysis, the nonlinearity caused by the row select transistor (M4) is omitted to simplify the analysis."

The 4T design offers several key advantages over the earlier 3T architecture. Most notably, it enables correlated double sampling (CDS), which significantly reduces reset noise (also known as $kTC$ noise). In the 4T pixel, the circuit first measures the voltage on the floating diffusion node before transferring charge from the photodiode (capturing a baseline), and then again after the charge is transferred. The difference between these two measurements represents the pixel signal. This subtraction cancels much of the noise introduced during the reset phase, improving signal-to-noise ratio.

Further improvements in materials and circuit architecture have led to even lower noise and higher quantum efficiency. Additional innovations, such as dual conversion gain and advanced pixel structures, have also expanded the dynamic range of CMOS sensors. We will explore some of these developments after reviewing the basic pixel circuit and other key sensor components.

## Circuit properties and parameters

Simulations of the CMOS circuitry can -and do- become very complex during the design phase, using highly specialized software that incorporates the manufacturing design rules. The software also accounts for material properties and feature sizes, helping the circuit designers achieve a working system from the foundry.

After the system is built, it is impractical to characterize each different line, devices and junction. Instead, systems are evaluated with respect to a set of objective measurements, in a process called **system characterization** or **system calibration**. The test measurements clarify the limitations of system performance, including light sensitivity, system noise, dynamic range, and color accuracy. The characterization measurements are chosen to be practical, and they are chosen to characterize key limitations based on knowledge of the circuit properties.

### Well capacity

The photodiodes and floating diffusion nodes are thought of as storage wells. The capacity to store electrons in the 3T and 4T circuits is called the **well capacity** or **full-well capacity**. This number is simply the maximum number of electrons that can be stored in the capacitor. If the number of photo-generated electrons exceeds the well capacity, the additional electrons cannot be stored and thus the output will no longer increase with increasing light intensity. Hence, the well capacity is an important consideration in sensor design and performance evaluation.

An estimate of the number of stored electrons as a function of number of incident photons, for a real sensor, is shown in @fig-sensor-responselinearity. The curve shows how the number of electrons increases linearly over a large part of the range.  At a certain level, however, the curve trails off and is sublinear.  As the light intensity increases even further, the curve saturates.  That is the well capacity, in this case about 70,000 electrons.

![A CMOS sensor response curve, showing the number of electrons captured as a function of the number of incident photons.  From @Bohndiek2008-sensorlinearity, Figure 7.](images/sensors/03-responselinearity.png){#fig-sensor-responselinearity width=60%}.

Why would the curve not continue on a straight line until reaching the well capacity? At most light intensities all of the electrons find their way into the storage well.  As the well starts to fill up, however, some of the electrons in the well start to leak out and some of the generated electrons don't make it into the storage - instead they leak into the substrate.  Hence, the curve bends. When this happens -or if it happens at all- will depend on specifics of the circuitry and its material properties. all of the As the storage fills up with electrons, some of the electrons will leakout.  Also, some of the electrons will simply not find their way into the capacitor, simply diffusing into the substrate.

### Dynamic range

For the basic circuitry, we can measure the dynamic range of the sensor using a relatively simple procedure.  First, we make a

Temperature dependence of circuit and sensor noise.

Temperature variations can also affect the linearity of the sensor. Changes in temperature can alter the behavior of the photodiode and the associated circuitry, leading to temperature-dependent nonlinearities. Modern sensors often include compensation mechanisms to mitigate these effects, but residual nonlinearities may still remain.

## Circuit innovations

Over time, as technology has scaled, more complex electrical circuitry has been placed on the sensor. Modern image sensors frequently include circuitry that performs local processing to increase the dynamic range of the sensor (well recycling), or to reduce the intrinsic noise (correlated double sampling). Some of this processing is *adaptive*, that is the circuit actions depend on the property of the input image. Consequently, the sensor output can depend upon both the control parameters set by the user and the image content.

### Dynamic range enhancement

Dynamic range extensions

Another source of nonlinearity arises from the photodiode itself. At high irradiance levels, the photodiode can saturate, meaning that it cannot generate additional electrons regardless of the incoming light. This saturation effect imposes a hard limit on the dynamic range of the sensor.

Understanding and modeling these nonlinearities is critical for applications that require high precision, such as scientific imaging or computational photography. Calibration techniques, such as measuring the sensor response under controlled conditions, can help correct for these nonlinearities in post-processing.
