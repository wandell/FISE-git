# Optics {#sec-optics}

A small enough pinhole renders a perfectly good image. Why do we need the additional complexity of optics? Further, while some animals have a visual system based on pinholes, the vast majority have evolved visual systems with a lens. Let's consider the advantages.

The critical limitation of the pinhole is that it only lets in a **small** amount of electromagnetic radiation. I should tell you what I mean by small. I calculated how many photons per area per time are available through the pinhole[^optics-1-1]. Suppose we have a typical cell phone camera - pixel with a 1 micron pixel and a focal length of 3.9mm, and exposure duration of 50 milliseconds. In a dim room illuminated with a broad wavelength spectrum, only about 35 photons arrive at each pixel. Because of unavoidable photon noise, which I describe later, this signal permits us to reliably detect a 20% contrast edge. If we further divide up the wavelength range, because we want to measure in color, the situation worsens. A lens permits us to use a larger aperture to sense more photons from the same scene, and it does so while solving the problem of blur. No wonder so many species decided it was a good idea.

[^optics-1-1]: The script *s_sensorCountingPhotons.m in ISETCam* implements the calculation.

For the next few sections, we are going to stick with Newton and consider light as rays. This will help with the understanding, and it will also be approximately correct. We will fix up the calculations, accounting for the fact that the wave description really is more accurate, later.

## Refraction and Snell's Law

The pinhole doesn't change the ray paths. It achieves a sharp image formation by only letting through a small subset of the rays. When there is a lot of radiation, that's fine. But we can't use a purely rejectionist approach when the radiation is weak. In that case, we must find a way to use the rays that the pinhole would reject.

I downloaded these slides. Some good concepts for this book. Overlaps a lot with my class, but additions. Link to PDF http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2020_fall/lectures/lecture3.pdf
