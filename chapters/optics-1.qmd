# Optics {#sec-optics}

We can create a perfectly good image using a pinhole. Why do we need the additional complexity of optics? While there are some animals with a visual system based on pinholes, the vast majority have evolved visual systems with a lens. Let's consider the advantages.

The first limitation of the pinhole is that, by definition, it lets in a very small amount of light. A 1 mm pinhole lets in only 1/25^th^ as much light as a 5 mm lens. In general, having a larger level of light is better for detecting contrast. Under many conditions, the light level available is a significant limit to capturing and rendering a high quality image. A larger pinhole aperture would blur the image greatly. A lens permits us to increase the area of the entrance aperture greatly.

Having more light energy is valuable, but only if the lens creates a sharp image that accurately reflects the position and edges of the objects in the scene.
