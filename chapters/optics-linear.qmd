# Linear optics {#sec-optics-linear}
Geometric optics is helpful for understanding and characterizing optical systems.  For simulating the conversion of the incident light field to the irradiance, at high spatial resolution, it is necessary to use linear system concepts to characterize the system.  The linear systems methodology, which is widely used in science and engineering, applies well to optical systems; most of the optics found in cameras and in biological systems are linear systems.

## Principle of superposition

## Point spread functions

## Line spread functions

Shift invariant point spread.

Relationship between point spread and line spread. psf2lsf easy, but to go back you need to assume something about the circular symmetry.

## Chromatic aberration

This is already in, earlier.  Maybe an example here? Explain transverse and longitudinal chromatic aberration here? 

## Isoplanatic regions (shift invariance)
OTFs.  MTFs.

## Optical Transfer Function

Relationship between OTF and PSF. Emphasis on this for a shift invariant, but not all possible cases. Local shift invariance is called aplanatic.
