# Linear optics {#sec-optics-linear}
Geometric optics is helpful for understanding and characterizing optical systems.  THe ideas in geometric optics are closely tied to the physical properties of the lenses and the electromagnetic signals.

For calculating how the incident light field is transformed to the optical light field, or the irradiance at the sensor, we typically use a signal processing approach. that applies to all systems whose input-output relationships satisfy a testable experimental property: the **Principle of Superposition**. 

The linear systems methodology is used in  many science and engineering disciplines, and we will see it repeatedly and in many different contexts in the rest of this book.

## Point spread functions

## Line spread functions

Shift invariant point spread.

Relationship between point spread and line spread. psf2lsf easy, but to go back you need to assume something about the circular symmetry.

## Chromatic aberration

This is already in, earlier.  Maybe an example here? Explain transverse and longitudinal chromatic aberration here? 

## Isoplanatic regions (shift invariance)
OTFs.  MTFs.

## Optical Transfer Function

Relationship between OTF and PSF. Emphasis on this for a shift invariant, but not all possible cases. Local shift invariance is called aplanatic.
