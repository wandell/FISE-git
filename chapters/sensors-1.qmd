# Sensors {#sec-sensors}

The Preface provides a very brief discussion of the history of image sensor technologies, from film to charge-coupled devices (CCD) and the invention of CMOS image sensors (CIS). Film, the first major commercial technology for capturing and storing image irradiance, relied heavily on chemistry.

![Film was the dominant image sensor and recording material for a hundred years. The chemistry of film for both encoding and developing into images was the core scientific discipline. Film could not be reused, producing a steady commercial profit for large companies, such as Kodak, Fuji, Polaroid and Agfa.](../images/sensors/film.png){#fig-film width="60%"}

Light-sensitive molecules were placed in multiple layers onto flexible rolls of plastic, and the roll was loaded into the darkened body of the camera. With the body closed, the film was mechanically advanced, placing a small flat section of film in the focal plane behind the lens. To take a picture, shutter was opened and the spectral irradiance from the lens formed an image on the film. The light changed the structure of molecules in the layers with molecules that were designed to encode the image. For color film, there were multiple layers that differed in their wavelength sensitivity. These molecular changes represented the local brightness of the captured image in different wavebands. Using chemical processes, the density of changes to the light-sensitive molecules could be measured and transferred to other media, such as prints. This process required a variety of chemical consumables, and the film could not be reused. Specialized labs were needed to create the film and to develop and printing the image. Some home hobbyists could develop the film, but mainly the processes were carried out by large commercial organizations.

The transition to electronics emerged with the discovery that semiconductor technology could also be used to record irradiance @boyle1970-ccd-first. Light incident on the silicon releases electrons (photoelectric effect), and the spatial pattern of these electrons can be stored and measured. This breakthrough was first implemented in 1970 by Michael Tompsett, who developed the image sensor known as the charge-coupled device (CCD). The semiconductor based sensor revolutionized imaging, moving it from a field based on chemistry to electrical engineering. Importantly, the digital readout from these electrical devices could be immediately integrated with computers. Images could be stored, shared, edited and analyzed directly from the camera output. 

The step from the CCD sensor to the CMOS sensor was another major advance that unleashed a massive adoption of electronic image sensors around the world. This chapter is about the properties of the CMOS image sensors used to measure radiance. In later sections, we will also describe how semiconductor sensors can be used to estimate depth, as well. Because there are significant differences in these technologies and the information they acquire, we treat them in separate sections.

## CMOS image sensors (CIS)

### Transduction
A CMOS image sensor (CIS) includes multiple components, and much of this chapter is devoted to explaining what these components do.  The basic principle is fairly simple:  The energy in the incident light field is encoded by the photodiodes in the image sensor array. Each photodiode converts the irradiance at its aperture electrons.  These are stored in a capacitor, and the voltage in the capacitor is readout by the circuitry. The initial transduction from light to electrons, the photoelectric effect, is linear over a large range: the number of electrons is proportional to the number of incident photons. A basic understanding of CIS principles begins with this linear formulation.

### Electronic circuitry
In the real device, nonlinearities do arise. Some of these are caused by the circuitry that manages the acquisition, storage, and readout of the data. These basic circuit functions introduce nonlinearities of a few percent @Wang2017-CMOSLinearity, and hardware design choices can influence the degree of nonlinearity. For example, the capacitance of the storage element and the characteristics of the amplifiers used in the readout process can both contribute to deviations from linearity.

Another source of nonlinearity arises from the photodiode itself. At high irradiance levels, the photodiode can saturate, meaning that it cannot generate additional electrons regardless of the incoming light. This saturation effect imposes a hard limit on the dynamic range of the sensor.

Temperature variations can also affect the linearity of the sensor. Changes in temperature can alter the behavior of the photodiode and the associated circuitry, leading to temperature-dependent nonlinearities. Modern sensors often include compensation mechanisms to mitigate these effects, but residual nonlinearities may still remain.

Understanding and modeling these nonlinearities is critical for applications that require high precision, such as scientific imaging or computational photography. Calibration techniques, such as measuring the sensor response under controlled conditions, can help correct for these nonlinearities in post-processing.

Over time, as technology has scaled, more complex electrical circuitry has been placed on the sensor. Modern image sensors frequently include circuitry that performs local processing to increase the dynamic range of the sensor (well recycling), or to reduce the intrinsic noise (correlated double sampling). Some of this processing is *adaptive*, that is the circuit actions depend on the property of the input image. Consequently, the sensor output can depend upon both the control parameters set by the user and the image content.  

### Optical components

There are also other non-electrical components of most image sensors. These are small lens (lenslet) arrays and small color filter arrays that influence which part of the irradiance is capable of producing electrons from each photodiode.

The sensor records the light that exits from the back of the imaging optics. The photodiodes are small and they are located at the bottom of small holes in the sensor. It is necessary to guide the irradiance from the camera lens with an array of microlenses that account for the position of the pixel with respect to the center of the lens. The original role of the microlens array was to compensate for the challenges inherent in this geometry. Overtime, the microlens array has been designed to achieve additional objectives including determining how to focus the image and estimate the scene light field.

To make a color image, the sensor must measure some information about the relative intensity of different wavelengths. To make this measurement small color filters are placed in front of each pixel, so that different pixels are sensitive to different wavelengths. These spectral encoding differences enable the system to reconstruct a color image that is convincing to the human visual system.

## ARVS mobile photography article

I was reading @delbracio-mobile-2021 and it surprised me how it glossed over various claims. For example, a small sensor was deemed to be worse than a big sensor without reference to pixel size. The notion that one had to apply gain and thus multiply the noise without considering the light level or pixel size. No mention of well capacity.

Probably some of this stuff is true, some is false, but the whole article doesn't explain the way we should do here. Also, this kind of vague stuff:

3.2.7. Tone mapping. A tone map is a 1D LUT that is applied per color channel to adjust the tonal values of the image. Figure 10 shows an example. Tone mapping serves two purposes. First, combined with color manipulation, it adjusts the image’s aesthetic appeal, often by increasing the contrast. Second, the final output image is usually only 8 to 10 bits per channel (i.e., 256 or 1,024 tonal values), while the raw-RGB sensor represents a pixel’s digital value using 10–14 bits (i.e., 1,024 up to 16,384 tonal values). As a result, it is necessary to compress the tonal values from the wider tonal range to a tighter range via tone mapping. This adjustment is reminiscent of the human eye’s adaptation to scene brightness (Land 1974). Figure 11 shows a typical 1D LUT used for tone mapping.



### Curved sensors
Finally, it is possible to reduce spherical aberration by changing the imaging surface. An image system that couples a spherical lens with an appropriately curved sensor can have very small spherical aberration. This idea is partly inspired by the fact that the retina in many animals lines the interior of the eyeball, forming a curved sensor surface. While this is not widely used, there have been several projects to create sensors on bendable materials, including some very expensive research projects. The idea is to build these sensors for cameras with very large field of view and very high resolution across the field of view.
