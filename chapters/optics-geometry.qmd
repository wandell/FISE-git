# Geometric optics {#sec-optics-thinlens}

Many image system properties can be summarized by ray tracing. This analysis characterizes critical performance characteristics of an optical system, such as its focal length, magnification, and depth of field. These optical properties can be analyzed in a particularly simple and clear way if we consider very simple thin lenses. This has some practical value as well because image systems are often made from lenses that are well approximated by a collection thin lenses. In some cases we can describe the whole system by calculating how multiple thin lenses combine to form the whole optical system. And in other cases, an entire image system can be characterized using these same concepts.

Another reason to understand image systems by ray tracing is that many people, including most photographers, rely on these parameters when they describe optical system characteristics. Familiarity with these ray trace characterizations is important for anyone working in the field of image systems engineering.

The simplest way to introduce these ideas is to use a thin lens model. We couple ray tracing methods with geometry and occasional linear algebra to derive certain performance characteristics. Ray tracing is not up to the task of a full simulation that calculates how the incident light field is transformed into optical light field. Such a calculation requires using linear system methods and accounting for the wave properties of light, for example to incorporate diffraction. We will explain the methods used for simulating the spectral irradiance at the sensor in subsequent chapters (@sec-optics-wavefront). Here we introduce ways to understand the summaries of an image system that can be revealed by ray tracing.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="What is a thin lens?"}
If the lens width is much smaller than the *radius of curvature* of its two surfaces, it is called a *thin lens*. The radius of the circle that (at least approximately) conforms to the surface of the lens is the radius of curvature. There is no universally agreed upon numerical value for what is meant by much smaller, but it is common to consider a lens whose width is one-tenth or less of the radius of curvature to be a thin lens.

![(a) This lens width is smaller than the radius of the circle that matches its surface. The lens might be considered thin. (b) This lens width is approximately equal to the radius of curvature. It is not be a thin lens.](../images/optics/thinlens-definition.png){#fig-thinlens-definition fig-align="center" width="60%"}

The ISET3d calculations make use of all of the principles below and are based on rays. The ISETCam calculations make use of the principles below, as well. But the image formation calculation treats the lens as modifying the wavefront of the light. We describe this approach in [@sec-optics-wavefront].

## Focal points

@fig-thinlens-focalpoints shows the important concept of the primary and secondary focal points of a convex and concave thin lens. The primary focal point (F) is the location on the optical axis such that any ray coming from it towards the lens travels parallel to the axis after refraction. The distance from that point to the middle of the lens is called the *focal length*. The secondary focal point The secondary focal point (F') is the axial point such that any incident ray traveling parallel to the axis will, after refraction, proceed toward, or appear to come from it. The secondary focal point has its own focal length.

![(a) The primary (F) and secondary (F') focal points of a convex (left) and concave (right) thin lens. Read the diagram with the light rays (dark, solid lines) traveling from left to right. The dashed lines drawn on the concave lens are virtual rays that are shown to clarify how the focal point is found. See the text for an explanation.](../images/optics/thinlens-focalpoints.png){#fig-thinlens-focalpoints fig-align="center" width="100%"}

Consider the equiconvex lens at the top left of @fig-thinlens-focalpoints. The rays emitted from primary focal point, F, arrive at the lens and are refracted and exit parallel to the main axis. On the bottom left the rays arrive in parallel, and they are refracted towards the secondary focal point, F'.

The equiconcave lens at the top right of @fig-thinlens-focalpoints shows its primary focal point. The incident rays that produce a collection of parallel rays exiting have a range of angles. The dashed lines extend these incident rays, showing that they converge at focal point F, on the right side. The bottom right shows the case when the incident rays are paralle. The diverge after refraction. The dashed lines we extend them backwards, showing that they converge on the left side of the lens, at the secondary focal point F'.

## Biconvex lenses

![Different radii of curvature for a thin lens.](../images/optics/thinlens-asymmetric.png){#fig-thinlens-asymmetric fig-align="center" width="100%"}

The lenses drawn in @fig-thinlens-focalpoints are symmetric (i.e., equiconvex and equiconcave). It is not surprising, therefore, that the focal lengths of the primary and secondary focal points are equal. It is more surprising to learn that even if the thin lens has a different curvature on the two sides, the two focal lengths will still be equal [@fig-thinlens-asymmetric]. We will explain this after we introduce the lensmaker's equation, below.

There are many other useful calculations that one can explore with simple lenses and ray tracing. Here, we cover the very basics to give the reader some of the terminology and a sense of how these systems are analyzed. For a deeper dive, I suggest the reader look into some of the excellent textbooks on optics (References here. Usually Goodman; Born and Wolf; I like Jenkins and White.)

## Three ray trace principles {#sec-3principles}

Consider the vector object on the left of @fig-lensmaker-center. A ray from the arrowhead that is parallel to the axis will be refracted through the focal point. A ray from origin of the vector, which is on the optical axis, will also pass through the focal point. Finally, a ray from the arrowhead - and this is new - that passes through the center of the lens will continue on a straight path.

![Tracing an object through the lens to an image.](../images/optics/lensmaker-center.png){#fig-lensmaker-center fig-align="center" width="70%"}

In summary, rays that

-   Enter parallel to the optical axis and pass through the focal point on the opposite side.

-   Pass through the center of the lens do not deviate (refract).

-   Pass through the primary focal point toward the lens exit parallel to the optical axis.

## Focal plane

They rays from a distant point off the optical approach the entrance as parallel to one another but oblique to the optical axis. The ray that passes through the center of the lens is called the *chief ray*. There will also be a ray that passes through the primary focal point. It will be refracted by the lens and emerge as parallel to the optical axis. These two rays intersect where the image of the point will be formed.

## Lens power (diopters)

The *power* of a lens is the inverse of the focal length, in meters. The unit for lens power, $1/m$ is the *diopter*. A short focal length implies large power, either due to the curvature of the lens surface or the refractive index of the lens material.

![Lens power is the inverse of focal length. The unit of lens power is diopter.](../images/optics/lensparameters-power.png){#fig-thinlens-power fig-align="center" width="80%"}

To measure the focal length of a lens we use a light source that produces parallel rays at the entrance aperture of the lens. We then slide the image plane back and forth, searching for the distance where the spot is smallest. We can create parallel rays using many methods. Perhaps the simplest is to use a small point source (e.g., an LED) at a distance from the lens. The rays arriving at the lens will be a small angular sliver of the emitted rays, and if the source is far from the lens the rays will be very close to parallel (e.g., @fig-pinhole-basic). An alternative, is to go outside on a sunny day and use the sun as a source. The sun isn't small, but it is really far away. By the time the rays from the disk of the sun arrive at your lens, the rays will be parallel.

The optics in the human eye has multiple elements. Even so, we can measure its focal length, which is about 0.016 m (\~60 diopters). To bring objects at different distances into focus the optics adjusts its power, a process called *accommodation*. If it cannot adjust adequately, we wear lenses (glasses, contact lenses) that increase or decrease the optical power, say by 1-8 diopters, so that a good image can be focused on the retina.

Young people can accommodate easily. As people age, we lose the ability to change the optical power of the optics, a condition called *presbyopia*. This happens to everyone. This biological fact is a consideration for the design of near field displays (@sec-displays).

## The lens formula
When an object is far away, the rays arriving at the lens are parallel. The image of the object will be in focus at the focal length. When the object is closer, we can use the *Lens formula* to find the plane where the object will be in focus. The equation, which was derived by Halley in 1693, relies on the three ray tracing properties of symmetric thin lenses (@sec-3principles). Using these principles, we can locate where the object at a distance $d_o$ will be in focused on the image side; call that distance $d_i$. 

![Similar triangles for the lens formula.](../images/optics/lensmaker-similartriangles.png){#fig-lensmaker-similartriangles fig-align="center" width="95%"}

The rays in @fig-lensmaker-similartriangles identify two pairs of similar triangles (cyan and yellow). On the left, we can see that the triangles imply $h_i/h_o = d_i/d_o$.  On the right, we can see that the triangle similarity implies $h_i/h_o = \frac{d_i - f}{f}$.  Combining the two equalities, we have

$$\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{d_i - f}{f} = \frac{d_i}{f} - 1 $$ 

rearranging terms, 
$$ \frac{d_i}{f}  = 1 + \frac{d_i}{d_o} $$

and dividing by $d_i$ we have the lens formula

$$ \frac{1}{f}    = \frac{1}{d_i} + \frac{1}{d_o} $$   {#eq-lensformula}

## Focal distance
The location of the image plane, where an object is represented in best focus, depends on the distance from the lens to the object. This is the **focal distance.  Notice that when $d_o = \infty$, then $d_i = f$.  We can re-write the lens formula to calculate this distance. Thus, if we know the focal length, $f$, and the distance to an object, $d_o$, we can calculate the distance to the focal plane, $d_i$ as

$$\frac{-1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{d_o} - \frac{1}{f}$$
$$ d_i =  \frac{1}{\frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o}}$$
$$ d_i = \frac{f~d_o}{d_o - f} $$  {#eq-focaldistance}

You can see from [@eq-focaldistance] that as $d_o$ becomes much larger than $f$, $d_i$ becomes approximately $f$. Specifically, if we express $d_o$ in terms of the focal length of the lens, $k f$, we have 

$$d_i = \frac{f k f}{(k-1) f} = f \frac{k}{k-1}$$

This script plots the focal distance as a function of object distance expressed as a multiple of focal length.

The lens formula computes the focal distance for a lens of known focal length.  How do we calculate the focal length of a thin lens? There is a formula we can use to calculate the focal length of a thin lens with (a) both sides approximately spherical, and (b) embedded in a homogeneous environment.

Suppose the refractives index of the lens is $n_2$ and of the surrounding medium is $n_1$. Suppose that the radius of curvature of the first surface is $R_1$ and the second surface $R_2$. The formula for the focal length is

$$\frac{1}{f} = (\frac{n_2}{n_1} - 1) ( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}) $$ {#eq-lensmaker}

Notice that flipping the shape of the lens, so that $R_2$ and $R_1$ exchange, the magnitude of the focal length remains the same; it just changes sign.  So the magnitude of the primary and secondary focal lengths are the same for such thin lenses.

Here is a link to a very nice [video derivation of the formula](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/in-in-class-12th-physics-india/in-in-ray-optics-and-optical-instruments/in-in-refraction-in-thin-lenses/v/lens-makers-formula).

## The f-number (f/#)
The f-number (f/#) of a thin lens is the ratio of its focal length and entrance aperture diameter (@fig-fnumber). For example, when we write f/4, it means that the focal length is 4x the aperture diameter.

![Graphic of the f/#.](../images/optics/lensparameters-fnumber.png){#fig-fnumber fig-align="center" width="50%"}

The f/# is an important parameter for all thin lenses, and it appears in many formulae. It is the only free parameter of a circular, diffraction-limited thin lens. This is an important case for assessing system performance because it represents an upper bound on lens performance.  If we simulate performance of a system assuming diffraction-limited optics, we cannot improve the system by using better optics.

As an example, the Airy disk diameter (meters) on the focal plane of a diffraction limited lens depends only on the wavelength of light and the f/# of the lens. If the wavelength is $\lambda$ and f/# is $F$, the formula for the Airy disk diameter is

$$ d = 2.44 ~ \lambda ~ F$$ {#eq-airy2}

If you revisit the first calculation of the Airy disk, in @sec-lightfields-diffraction, you will see that this formula is implicit in how we modeled the image from a diffraction limited pinhole [@eq-airy1].

<!-- 
You're right, the Double Gauss is a classic! Here are some other famous lens designs often encountered in basic optics courses:

* **Cooke Triplet:** A three-element lens system known for its simplicity and good image quality. It's a foundational design that has been modified and adapted in many ways.
* **Tessar:** An evolution of the Cooke Triplet, adding a fourth element to improve performance and correct aberrations. 
* **Petzval Lens:** Historically significant, known for its large aperture but limited field of view. It's still used in some specialized applications. 
* **Biotar:** A fast lens design known for its distinctive rendering characteristics, often used in portrait photography.

These examples represent different approaches to lens design, balancing factors like image quality, size, cost, and complexity. 

Do any of these particularly interest you? I can try to provide more details about their specific features and historical significance.
