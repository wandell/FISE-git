# Thick lens {#chapter-optics-thicklens}

Jensen and White has good text on this. I will look for text from other sources, such as Goodman. But there are some simplifications that should be mentioned, including the two focal lengths and two nodal points.

## Multi-element lenses and the ABCD ray transfer matrix

Leads nicely into the Ray Transfer Function concept returns to the optical light field in previous

Maybe write a new ISETCam script with the ABCD implementation?

Double Gauss lens. Fish eye lens.

Use Ray Transfer images here in some way.  Maybe introduce the metalens concept.  Maybe even the spatial light modulator.  They could go in a next section/chapter.
