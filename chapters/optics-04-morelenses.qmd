# Lenses and ray transfer  {#sec-optics-morelenses}
The basic principles of lens design described in @sec-geometric-optics and @sec-optics-thinlens remain the foundations of multi-element lens analysis. The first lens is traced, and its output is the input to a second lens. We can use the three principles (@sec-optics-3principles) to analyze the lenses in sequence. Using these tools, but with increasing complexity, the methods used to characterize thin lenses (@sec-optics-thinlens) can be extended to many different optical functions. 

In this chapter, I will illustrate some of the extensions to thick lenses and multi-element lenses. These have been important historically, and they will continue to be with us for some years.

But a main goal is to lead you to the next level of optics, and in particular the notion of the *ray transfer matrix* and the *ray transfer function (RTF)* first introduced in @sec-optics-metalens.  This idea conceptualizes optics in terms of how the rays in the incident light field are transformed into the rays in the optical light field. Characterizing a system in terms of a transformation, in this case a function that transforms the rays from one ight field into another, is an abstraction that is applicable to many aspects of image systems engineering. Conceiving of the pipeline as a series of transformaqtions, from capture to display, organizes how we think of simulations. The approach may even apply to image understanding. 

But let's start here, with increasingly complex optics.

## Thick lenses 
A lens that does not qualify as thin is called a **thick lens**. The basic principles of refraction and ray tracing still apply, but there is the added complexity of having to account for the fact that the rays propagate in a straight path within the lens.  This makes many of the formulas more complex.

## Famous multi-element lenses {#sec-optics-multielement}
From the earliest days of optics, using basic understanding of refraction of spherical lenses, scientists began to think about **multi-element lenses** that improved on thin, spherical lenses.

Jensen and White has good text on this. I will look for text from other sources, such as Goodman. But there are some simplifications that should be mentioned, including the two focal lengths and two nodal points. Propagation.

### Double Gauss {#sec-optics-double-gauss}
The great mathematician Gauss implemented proposed a design, the **Gauss lens** for astronomy.  This was improved upon by Alvan Clark and Paul Rudolph, who expanded on Gauss’s idea to introduce the first symmetrical double Gauss arrangement — essentially two of Gauss’s lens pairs, placed symmetrically around the stop .  Paul Rudolph at Zeiss refined this into the famous Planar lens (1896), which became the archetypal “double Gauss” photographic objective. This design, with later improvements (e.g. Taylor & Hobson’s Opic lens, 1920), became the dominant fast normal lens type for photography in the 20th century (@fig-double-gauss).

![Double Gauss multielement lens design. fise_lensExample.m initiated the drawing, which I modified in Affinity Designer. The evolution from Gauss' original lens design to the double Gauss and Planar design is nicely illustrated in [Wikipedia Double-Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-Gauss_lens).](images/optics/09-morelens/double-gauss-isetlens.png){#fig-double-gauss width="60%"}

### Other famous lens designs {#sec-optics-famous-lenses}

Many of the important early lens designs were purpose driven, such as Gauss' goal of building a telescope.  The Petzval lens was an important break through for enabling photographers to create portraits.  The Cooke Triplet, which evolved into the Petzval design, was important for, ...  The Fisheye lens is important for.  The three tabs in the image below illustrate these designs.  As you can imagine, there is a large university of shapes, spacing, and materials that were open for exploration.  As you might also imagine, the ability to search through this space with a goal in mind, and with increasingly large computers and purpose-built software to compute the properties of the optics, has been important to image systems engineering.

<!-- 
You're right, the Double Gauss is a classic! Here are some other famous lens designs often encountered in basic optics courses:

* **Cooke Triplet:** A three-element lens system known for its simplicity and good image quality. It's a foundational design that has been modified and adapted in many ways.
* **Tessar:** An evolution of the Cooke Triplet, adding a fourth element to improve performance and correct aberrations. 
* **Petzval Lens:** Historically significant, known for its large aperture but limited field of view. It's still used in some specialized applications. 
* **Biotar:** A fast lens design known for its distinctive rendering characteristics, often used in portrait photography.

These examples represent different approaches to lens design, balancing factors like image quality, size, cost, and complexity. 

Do any of these particularly interest you? I can try to provide more details about their specific features and historical significance.

## ABCD ray transfer matrix {#sec-optics-abcd}

Near the optical axis.  Do a calculation.  

Maybe write a new ISETCam script with the ABCD implementation?

Leads nicely into the Ray Transfer Function concept returns to the optical light field in previous

## Ray transfer functions {#sec-optics-raytransfer}
Use Ray Transfer Function.  Rely on the text from our paper. images here in some way. Maybe introduce the metalens concept. Maybe even the spatial light modulator. They could go in a next section/chapter.
