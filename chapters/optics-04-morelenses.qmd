# Lenses and ray transfer  {#sec-optics-morelenses}
The principles of geometric optics and thin lenses are also critical for thick lenses and multi-element lenses(@sec-geometric-optics). The first lens is traced, and its output is the input to a second lens. We can use the three principles (@sec-optics-3principles) to analyze the lenses in sequence. Using these tools, but with increasing complexity, the methods used to characterize thin lenses (@sec-optics-thinlens) can be extended to many different optical functions. 

In this chapter, I will illustrate some of the extensions to thick lenses and multi-element lenses. These have been important historically, and they will continue to be with us for some years.

But a main goal is to lead you to the next level of optics, and in particular the notion of the *ray transfer matrix* and the *ray transfer function (RTF)* first introduced in @sec-optics-metalens.  This idea conceptualizes optics in terms of how the rays in the incident light field are transformed into the rays in the optical light field. Characterizing a system in terms of a transformation, in this case a function that transforms the rays from one ight field into another, is an abstraction that is applicable to many aspects of image systems engineering. Conceiving of the pipeline as a series of transformaqtions, from capture to display, organizes how we think of simulations. The approach may even apply to image understanding. 

But let's start here, with increasingly complex optics.

## Combining two thin lenses
Let's take a simple step towards more complex optical systems by combining two thin lenses. When we place two lenses in series, the image formed by the first lens becomes the object for the second.

If the lenses have focal lengths $f_1$ and $f_2$ and are separated by a distance $d$, the *effective focal length* ($f$) of the combination is given by:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} - \frac{d}{f_1 f_2}
$${#eq-two-thin-lens}

This formula gives the focal length of an *equivalent* single thin lens. However, it's important to remember that this equivalent lens isn't located at the position of either of the original lenses. Its position is defined by the system's principal planes, which we'll discuss more in the context of thick lenses.

Recalling that the power of a lens (in diopters) is the inverse of its focal length, @eq-two-thin-lens shows that:
*   When the lenses are touching ($d \approx 0$), their powers simply add up: $P = P_1 + P_2$.
*   As the lenses are separated, the total power changes. If $d = f_1 + f_2$, the total power becomes zero ($f = \infty$). This specific arrangement is called a *focal telescope*, and it collimates light, meaning parallel incoming rays emerge as parallel outgoing rays.

A more practical value is the **back focal length (BFL)**, which is the distance from the back surface of the last lens to the system's final focal point. For our two-lens system, this is:

$$
\text{BFL} = \frac{f_2 (d - f_1 )}{d - (f_1 + f_2)}
$$ {#eq-back-focal-length}

The BFL tells you exactly where to place a sensor to capture a sharp image of an object at infinity. Notice that when $d = f_1 + f_2$, the denominator is zero, and the BFL becomes infinite, which is consistent with the parallel rays produced by a focal telescope.

## Thick lens definitions
The principles of refraction and ray tracing apply to both thin and thick lenses. However, for a **thick lens**, the optical design calculations must account for the distance rays travel *within* the lens material. This internal propagation distance is assumed to be zero in thin lens calculations, which is a key simplification.

We can extend the three principles used for thin spherical lenses (@sec-optics-3principles) to analyze thick lenses. The concept of the focal point remains the same: Rays arriving parallel to the optical axis converge toward the image-side focal point ($F_2$). Conversely, rays passing through the object-side focal point ($F_1$) emerge parallel to the optical axis.

![Nodal points and principal planes of a thick lens.](images/optics/09-morelens/cardinal-points.png){#fig-cardinal-points width="60%"}

For a thin lens, we noted that a ray passing through the optical center is undeviated. A thick lens has a similar concept, but it involves two **nodal points** ($N_1$ and $N_2$). A ray directed toward the object-side nodal point ($N_1$) emerges from the lens as if it came from the image-side nodal point ($N_2$), traveling parallel to its original direction (Panel A, @fig-cardinal-points).

To handle the ray's path, it is also convenient to define two **principal planes** ($P_1$ and $P_2$). Consider rays parallel to the optical axis entering the lens. They exit the lens converging toward the focal point. If we extend the incoming parallel ray forward and the outgoing converging ray backward, they intersect. The locus of these intersection points for rays near the optical axis forms the image-side principal plane, $P_2$ (Panel B, @fig-cardinal-points). A similar construction using rays from the front focal point defines the object-side principal plane, $P_1$. The intersection of a principal plane with the optical axis is called a **principal point**.

In the general case, a thick lens is characterized by six **cardinal points**: two focal points, two principal points, and two nodal points. However, in the common situation where the medium on both sides of the lens is the same (e.g., air), the nodal points coincide with the principal points. This simplifies the system considerably (@fig-thick-cardinal).

![Thick spherical lens definitions. By convention, light travels from left to right. A general thick lens has six cardinal points: two focal points ($F_1, F_2$), two principal points ($P_1, P_2$), and two nodal points ($N_1, N_2$). The principal planes are perpendicular to the optical axis at the principal points. When the medium on both sides of the lens is the same (e.g., air), the nodal points coincide with the principal points ($N_1=P_1, N_2=P_2$), and the focal lengths are equal.](images/optics/09-morelens/thick-cardinal-defintions.png){#fig-thick-cardinal width=90%}

Just as the thin lens has a lensmaker's formula (@eq-lensmaker), a similar equation exists for a thick spherical lens to calculate its effective focal length:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left ( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{(n - 1) d}{n R_1 R_2} \right )
$$ {#eq-lensmaker-thick}

Here, $n$ is the refractive index of the lens material relative to the surrounding medium, $d$ is the lens thickness, and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces. The formula differs from the thin lens version by an extra term that accounts for the lens thickness, $d$.

While this formula works for a single thick lens, applying it repeatedly for a multi-element system becomes unwieldy. A more powerful and systematic approach uses matrix multiplication, which I will introduce after we discuss multi-element lenses.

## Multi-element lenses
From the earliest days of optics, using basic understanding of refraction of spherical lenses, scientists began to think about **multi-element lenses** that improved on thin, spherical lenses. 

<!--
Jensen and White has good text on this. I will look for text from other sources, such as Goodman. But there are some simplifications that should be mentioned, including the two focal lengths and two nodal points. Propagation.

## Famous multi-element lenses {#sec-optics-multielement}
The development of photography, such as daguerrotype in 1839[^daguerrotype], created a significant market for optical design.  People wanted to take pictures of themselves, their family, and their friends.  The low light sensitivity of the recording media made it difficult to create portraits using a pinhole camera. Also, the pinhole camera does not produce a flat field image (SEC REF).  Lens designers set out to make portraits possible.  Much of this was enabled by the development of new types of glass with different optical properties, especially from Fraunhofer's work in Bavaria (SEC FRAUNHOFER REF).  Having a palette of materials to use made the design possible.

[^daguerrotype]: a photograph using an early photographic process employing an iodine-sensitized silvered plate and mercury vapor.

The development of mathematical methods for predicting the outcome for lenses with different shapes and materials was also important. Both Gauss and Petzval were mathematicians who developed workable methods for simulating the impact of a design prior to construction. Robert Wood, an American physicist, coined the term “fish-eye” lens to describe how a fish would see the world through a 180° hemisphere of water[^wood-fisheye]. He designed a lens to mimic this — essentially a hemispherical objective producing a circular image. For all of those designers, mathematics was the key simulation tool. In the modern era, as this book illustrates in many places, mathematics is extended into computable algorithms. These are our modern tools, but don't sleep on the importance of mathematics!

[^wood-fisheye]: "In discussing the peculiar type of refraction which occurs when light from the sky enters the surf'ace of still water, it seems of interest to ascertain how the external world appears to the fish. As is well known, a sublnerged eye directed towards the surface of still water sees the sky compressed into a comparatively small circle of light, the centre of which is always immediately above the observer, the appearance being as if the pond were covered with an opaque roof' provided
with a circular aperture or window. I f our eyes were adapted to distinct vision under water, it is clear that the objects surrounding the pond, such as trees, horses, fishermen, &c., would appear round the edge of this circle of light. Objects not lnuch
elevated above the plane of the water would be seen somewhat compressed and distorted, but the circular picture would contain everything embraced within an angle of 180 ~ in every direction, i.e. a complete hemisphere" @wood1906-fisheye

Finally, in those days like these, different design goals led to diversity. Gauss was primarily interested in astronomical lenses with low distortion. Petzval proritized light sensitivty for portraiture. Cooke (1893) later produced the famous triplet, which became the Tessar, to achieve a compact lens that balanced aberrations across the field. Woods' fish-eye became a scientific tool that enabled measurements of the sky, military reconnaisance and artistic architectural overviews.

### Double Gauss {#sec-optics-double-gauss}
The great mathematician Gauss implemented proposed a design, the **Gauss lens** for astronomy.  This was improved upon by Alvan Clark and Paul Rudolph, who expanded on Gauss’s idea to introduce the first symmetrical double Gauss arrangement — essentially two of Gauss’s lens pairs, placed symmetrically around the stop .  Paul Rudolph at Zeiss refined this into the famous Planar lens (1896), which became the archetypal “double Gauss” photographic objective. This design, with later improvements (e.g. Taylor & Hobson’s Opic lens, 1920), became the dominant fast normal lens type for photography in the 20th century (@fig-double-gauss).

![Double Gauss multielement lens design. fise_lensExample.m initiated the drawing, which I modified in Affinity Designer. The evolution from Gauss' original lens design to the double Gauss and Planar design is nicely illustrated in [Wikipedia Double-Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-Gauss_lens).](images/optics/09-morelens/double-gauss-isetlens.png){#fig-double-gauss width="60%"}

### Tessar, Petzval and Fisheye {#sec-optics-famous-lenses}

The three tabs in the image below illustrate the Tessar, Petzval and Fisheye designs. As you can imagine from inspecting these lens diagrams, there is a large university of shapes, spacing, and materials that were open for exploration.  As you might also imagine, the ability to search through this space with a goal in mind, and with increasingly large computers and purpose-built software to compute the properties of the optics, has been important to image systems engineering.
