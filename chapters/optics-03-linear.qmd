# Optics and linear systems {#sec-optics-linear}
Geometric optics is helpful for understanding and characterizing many optical system properties. The ideas in geometric optics are closely tied to the physical properties of the lenses which makes geometric optics a particularly valuable tool in lens design.

Another way to consider an optical system is to think of how the radiation incident at the entrance aperture is transformed into radiation incident at the sensor surface.  This point of view treats the optics as transforming one spctral image (the irradiance from the incident light field) into a second spectral image (the irradiance at the sensor surface).  This characterization of the optics is thinking of the system in terms of signal processing, a valuable approach for system simulation.  

This treatment is particularly important for optics because so many important optical systems are linear.  Specifically, they satisfy the (testable) experimental property called the **Principle of Superposition**. Linear systems are found in many science and engineering disciplines, and we will see the idea repeatedly and in many different contexts in the rest of this book.  

## Principle of superposition
When characterizing a system, the scientist or engineer's first hope is that its input-output relationship is approximately linear. We say a system, $L$, is linear if it satisfies the superposition rule: 

$$
L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y).
$$ {#eq-superposition}

The variables $x$ and $y$ are two possible inputs to the system, and $x+y$ is their superposition. $L(x)$ is the output of the system.  In the optical system case that we are considering, $x$ might be the spectral image at the entrance aperture of the optics and $L(x)$ might be the spectral image at the exit aperture.

There is a special case of superposition,  **Homogeneity**, that is often separated out.

$$
L(\alpha x) = \alpha L(x)
$$ {#eq-homogeneity}

 Homogeneity is a consequence of the superposition rule. Consider superimposing an input on itself

$$\begin{aligned}
L(x + x) &= L(2x) \nonumber  \\ 
&= L(x) + L(x) \nonumber \\
&= 2L(x). \nonumber
\end{aligned}$$

This is easily generalized for any integer $m$ to show that [^optics-linearity]

$$
L(m x) = m  L(x).
$$

It is useful to remember that some systems obey homogeneity but not the superposition. For example, $f(x) = \lvert x \rvert$.

Another important case is the Euclidean norm of a vector, 

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{x}\|_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}.
$$ 

Both satisfy homogeneity, but neither satisifies superposition. 

The famous $ReLu$ function used in neural networks satisfies homogeneity $ReLu(x) = max(0,x)$, for $\alpha > 0$, without satisfying superposition

$$
ReLu( 2 + 1)) \neq ReLu(2) + ReLu(1)
$$

No system is completely linear:  if you put enough energy into a system it will blow up. But many systems are linear over a meaningful input range (sometimes call their *compliance range*).  Many other systems are locally linear when measured using small perturbations.

[^optics-linearity]: Real-valued systems that follow the superposition rule obey the homogeneity rule for any rational number, not just for integers.  Consider $L(\frac{p}{q}x)$ and carry on.  If you want all real numbers, you need continuity.  But, we are engineers, are we not?

### Point spread functions
There is an immediate practical consequence of superposition for optics.  The input to a lens is a scene that comprises the intensity across a set of points, $I(\mathbf{p})$. If we can measure how the optics spreads the light from every point, $\mathbf{p} = (p_x, p_y, p_z)$, then we can calculate the expected image just from the point spread functions. Suppose the point spread functions, defined for each point, are $\mathbf{p}$ is $PSF_p()$.  Then the image can be calculated as the intensity of the scene times the point spread, summed across all points

$$
\sum_{\mathbf{p}} I(\mathbf{p}) PSF_p .
$$ {#eq-pointspread-1}

There are some details of this calculation -related to the possibility that objects in three-space can block the light from a point- that make this formula not quite right. But if all the points are on a plane, or everything is far away, the calculation is about right. I want you to get the principle of adding up point spreads as a good start. We are engineers, are we not?

## Shift-invariant linear systems

The idea of shift invariance - whether referring to a shift in space or a shift in time - is an important special feature of a linear system. When a system is shift-invariant, we can model and characterize it and very efficiently, based on only a few measurements.

The image formation component (optics) of most image systems are typically linear, but they are not fully shift-invariant.  Even so, one often finds a region near the main optical axis of a system that is spatially shift invariant. Our colleagues in optics call these spatially shift invariant regions *isoplanatic*.  

Some mathematical notation is useful, as a reminder. Suppose we express image translation as a function, say expressing translation of an image, $x$, by an amount, $\delta$, as $T(x,\delta)$. The linear relationship from the input to the output of the optics is $L(x)$. An isoplanatic region means that the linear transform of a translated image is approximately equal to the translation of the linear response. 

$$L(T(x,\delta)) \approx T(L(x),\alpha \delta)$$.  

Notice that the size of the shift of the image differs on the input, $x$, and output $L(x)$, by a scale factor, $\alpha$. This scale factor depends on the image magnfication.

### Point spread functions


Relationship between point spread and line spread. psf2lsf easy, but to go back you need to assume something about the circular symmetry.

### Harmonics 
Almost eigenfunctions.  Not quite because of phase.  If we treat the harmonics as 2-dimensional vectors, then they are eigenfunctions.

### Optical Transfer Function

### Modulation Transfer

### Contrast sensitivity

## Chromatic aberration

This is already in, earlier.  Maybe an example here? Explain transverse and longitudinal chromatic aberration here?
