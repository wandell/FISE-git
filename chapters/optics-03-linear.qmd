# Optics and linear systems {#sec-optics-linear}
Geometric optics is helpful for understanding and characterizing many optical system properties. The ideas in geometric optics are closely tied to the physical properties of the lenses which makes geometric optics a particularly valuable tool in lens design.

Another way to consider an optical system is to think of how the radiation incident at the entrance aperture is transformed into radiation incident at the sensor surface.  This point of view treats the optics as transforming one spctral image (the irradiance from the incident light field) into a second spectral image (the irradiance at the sensor surface).  This characterization of the optics is thinking of the system in terms of signal processing, a valuable approach for system simulation.  

This treatment is particularly important for optics because so many important optical systems are linear.  Specifically, they satisfy the (testable) experimental property called the **Principle of Superposition**. Linear systems are found in many science and engineering disciplines, and we will see the idea repeatedly and in many different contexts in the rest of this book.  

## Principle of superposition
When characterizing a system, the scientist or engineer's first hope is that its input-output relationship is approximately linear. We say a system, $L$, is linear if it satisfies the superposition rule: 

$$
L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y).
$$ {#eq-superposition}

The variables $x$ and $y$ are two possible inputs to the system, and $x+y$ is their superposition. $L(x)$ is the output of the system.  In the optical system case that we are considering, $x$ might be the spectral image at the entrance aperture of the optics and $L(x)$ might be the spectral image at the exit aperture.

There is a special case of superposition,  **homogeneity**, that is often separated out.

$$
L(\alpha x) = \alpha L(x)
$$ {#eq-homogeneity}

 Homogeneity is a consequence of the superposition rule. Consider adding an input to itself

$$\begin{aligned}
L(x + x) &= L(2x) \nonumber  \\ 
&= L(x) + L(x) \nonumber \\
&= 2L(x). \nonumber
\end{aligned}
$$

This is easily generalized for any integer $m$,

$$
L(m x) = m  L(x).
$$

Real-valued systems that obey superposition also obey homogeneity rule for any rational number, not just for integers. Suppose that $\alpha = \frac{p}{q}$ is a rational number. Then

$$
L(\alpha x) = L(\frac{p}{q}x) = p L(\frac{x}{q}) .
$$

Make the change of variable, $x\prime = x/q$, and notice that 

$$
\begin{align}
L(x) =& L(q x\prime) = q L(x\prime) \\
L(x\prime) =& \frac{1}{q} L(x) .
\end{align}
$$

Finally

$$
L(\alpha x) = L(\frac{p}{q}x) = L(p x\prime) = p L(x\prime) = p \frac{1}{q}L(x) = \frac{p}{q} L(x) = \alpha L(x)
$$

If you want all real numbers, not just the rationals, you need continuity.  But, we are engineers, are we not?
:::

It is useful to remember that some systems obey homogeneity but not superposition. Two examples are $f(x) = \lvert x \rvert$ and

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{x}\|_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2} 
$$ 

The function, $ReLu(x) = max(0,x)$, for $\alpha > 0$, is widely used in neural networks.  It too satisfies homogeneity without satisfying superposition

$$
1 = ReLu( 2 + -1) \neq ReLu(2) + ReLu(-1) = 2 + 0.
$$

As a practical matter, remember that no real system can be completely linear:  if you put enough energy into any system it will blow up! But many systems are linear over a meaningful input range called their **compliance range**. Many other systems are linear when measured using small perturbations.  So linear approximations and linear systems appear throughout mathematics, physics and engineering.

### Point spread functions
There is an immediate practical consequence of superposition for optics.  The input to the optics is a scene that with intensity $I(\mathbf{p})$ for every point in the scene, $\mathbf{p} = (p_x, p_y, p_z)$. The point spread functions define how the optics spreads the light from a point across the image $PSF_\mathbf{p}(x,y)$, for each point. 

With knowledge of these functions and a belief in superposition, we can calculate the image intensity for any input scene. The image is the intensity of the scene times the point spread, summed across all points

$$
O(x,y) = \sum_{\mathbf{p}} I(\mathbf{p}) PSF_\mathbf{p}(x,y) .
$$ {#eq-pointspread-1}

::: {.callout-note title="PSF limitation" collapse="true"}
Objects in three-space can occlude one another.  These occlusions mean that the pointspread from $\mathbf{p}$ may depend on the geometry of the scene. This limitation disturbs the perfect linearity formula. 

But if all the points are on a plane, or everything is far away, the calculation is about right. I want you to feel the principle of adding up point spreads because it is the right way to start. We are engineers, are we not?

## Shift-invariant linear systems

The idea of shift invariance - whether referring to a shift in space or a shift in time - is an important special feature of a linear system. When a system is shift-invariant, we can model and characterize it and very efficiently, based on only a few measurements.

The image formation component (optics) of most image systems are typically linear, but they are not fully shift-invariant.  Even so, one often finds a region near the main optical axis of a system that is spatially shift invariant. Our colleagues in optics call these spatially shift invariant regions *isoplanatic*.  

Some mathematical notation is useful, as a reminder. Suppose we express image translation as a function, say expressing translation of an image, $x$, by an amount, $\delta$, as $T(x,\delta)$. The linear relationship from the input to the output of the optics is $L(x)$. An isoplanatic region means that the linear transform of a translated image is approximately equal to the translation of the linear response. 

$$L(T(x,\delta)) \approx T(L(x),\alpha \delta)$$.  

Notice that the size of the shift of the image differs on the input, $x$, and output $L(x)$, by a scale factor, $\alpha$. This scale factor depends on the image magnfication.

### Point spread functions


Relationship between point spread and line spread. psf2lsf easy, but to go back you need to assume something about the circular symmetry.

### Harmonics 
Almost eigenfunctions.  Not quite because of phase.  If we treat the harmonics as 2-dimensional vectors, then they are eigenfunctions.

### Optical Transfer Function

### Modulation Transfer

### Contrast sensitivity

## Chromatic aberration

This is already in, earlier.  Maybe an example here? Explain transverse and longitudinal chromatic aberration here?
