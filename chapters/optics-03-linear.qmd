# Optics and Linear Systems {#sec-optics-linear}
Geometric optics is valuable for understanding and characterizing many properties of optical systems. Its concepts are closely linked to the physical characteristics of lenses, making geometric optics especially useful in lens design.

Another perspective is to view an optical system as a transformer: it converts the radiation entering the aperture into radiation at the sensor surface. This approach treats the optics as mapping one spectral image (the incident light field) into another (the irradiance at the sensor). Thinking of the system in terms of signal processing is a powerful method for system simulation and analysis.

## Linear Systems
This perspective is particularly important because many optical systems are approximately linear. Specifically, they satisfy the **Principle of Superposition**, a property that can be tested experimentally. Linear systems are common in science and engineering, and we will encounter this concept repeatedly throughout the book.

### Principle of Superposition
When analyzing a system, scientists and engineers often hope its input-output relationship is linear. A system $L$ is linear if it satisfies the superposition rule:

$$
L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y).
$$ {#eq-superposition}

Here, $x$ and $y$ are two possible inputs, and $L(x)$ is the system's response. For an optical system, $x$ might represent the incident light field at the entrance aperture, and $L(x)$ the spectral irradiance at the sensor surface.

No real system is perfectly linear—extreme inputs will always cause failure—but many systems are linear over a significant range of inputs. Others are locally linear, meaning they behave linearly for small signals. Linear and locally linear systems are fundamental in mathematics, physics, and engineering.

### Principle of Homogeneity
A special case of superposition is **homogeneity**:

$$
L(\alpha x) = \alpha L(x)
$$ {#eq-homogeneity}

Homogeneity follows from superposition. For example, adding an input to itself:

$$\begin{aligned}
L(x + x) &= L(2x) \nonumber  \\ 
&= L(x) + L(x) \nonumber \\
&= 2L(x). \nonumber
\end{aligned}
$$

This generalizes to any integer $m$:

$$
L(m x) = m L(x).
$$

For real-valued systems that obey superposition, homogeneity holds for any rational number. If $\alpha = \frac{p}{q}$ is rational:

$$
L(\alpha x) = L\left(\frac{p}{q}x\right) = p L\left(\frac{x}{q}\right).
$$

Let $x' = x/q$, so

$$
L(x) = L(q x') = q L(x') \implies L(x') = \frac{1}{q} L(x).
$$

Therefore,

$$
L(\alpha x) = p L(x') = p \frac{1}{q} L(x) = \frac{p}{q} L(x) = \alpha L(x).
$$

To extend this to all real numbers, continuity is required. But for most engineering purposes, this is sufficient.
:::

It is important to note that a system can be homogeneous without being linear. For example, $f(x) = |x|$ and the vector length function

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{x}\|_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}
$$

are homogeneous but not linear. The function $ReLU(x) = \max(0, x)$, widely used in neural networks, is also homogeneous for $\alpha > 0$ but not linear:

$$
1 = ReLU(2 + -1) \neq ReLU(2) + ReLU(-1) = 2 + 0.
$$


### Point spread functions
There is an immediate practical consequence of superposition for optics.  The input to the optics is a scene that with intensity $I(\mathbf{p})$ for every point in the scene, $\mathbf{p} = (p_x, p_y, p_z)$. The point spread functions define how the optics spreads the light from a point across the image $PSF_\mathbf{p}(x,y)$, for each point. 

With knowledge of these functions and a belief in superposition, we can calculate the image intensity for any input scene. The image is the intensity of the scene times the point spread, summed across all points

$$
O(x,y) = \sum_{\mathbf{p}} I(\mathbf{p}) PSF_\mathbf{p}(x,y) .
$$ {#eq-pointspread-1}

::: {.callout-note title="PSF limitation" collapse="true"}
Objects in three-space can occlude one another.  These occlusions mean that the pointspread from $\mathbf{p}$ may depend on the geometry of the scene. This limitation disturbs the perfect linearity formula. 

But if all the points are on a plane, or everything is far away, the calculation is about right. I want you to feel the principle of adding up point spreads because it is the right way to start. We are engineers, are we not?

## Shift-invariant linear systems

The idea of shift invariance - whether referring to a shift in space or a shift in time - is an important special feature of a linear system. When a system is shift-invariant, we can model and characterize it and very efficiently, based on only a few measurements.

The image formation component (optics) of most image systems are typically linear, but they are not fully shift-invariant.  Even so, one often finds a region near the main optical axis of a system that is spatially shift invariant. Our colleagues in optics call these spatially shift invariant regions *isoplanatic*.  

Some mathematical notation is useful, as a reminder. Suppose we express image translation as a function, say expressing translation of an image, $x$, by an amount, $\delta$, as $T(x,\delta)$. The linear relationship from the input to the output of the optics is $L(x)$. An isoplanatic region means that the linear transform of a translated image is approximately equal to the translation of the linear response. 

$$L(T(x,\delta)) \approx T(L(x),\alpha \delta)$$.  

Notice that the size of the shift of the image differs on the input, $x$, and output $L(x)$, by a scale factor, $\alpha$. This scale factor depends on the image magnfication.

### Point spread functions


Relationship between point spread and line spread. psf2lsf easy, but to go back you need to assume something about the circular symmetry.

### Harmonics 
Almost eigenfunctions.  Not quite because of phase.  If we treat the harmonics as 2-dimensional vectors, then they are eigenfunctions.

### Optical Transfer Function

### Modulation Transfer

### Contrast sensitivity

## Chromatic aberration

This is already in, earlier.  Maybe an example here? Explain transverse and longitudinal chromatic aberration here?
