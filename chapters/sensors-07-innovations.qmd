# System Innovations {#sec-sensor-innovations}
Over time, as technology has scaled, more complex electrical circuitry has been placed on the sensor. Modern image sensors frequently include circuitry that performs local processing to increase the dynamic range of the sensor (well recycling), or to reduce the intrinsic noise (correlated double sampling). Some of this processing is *adaptive*, that is the circuit actions depend on the property of the input image. Consequently, the sensor output can depend upon both the control parameters set by the user and the image content.

## Global Shutter Technology {#sec-sensor-globalshutter}
Instead of using a floating diffusion as a memory element, Aptina has utilized a surface-pinned storage node in the pixel to address dark current challenges. Available in its newest global shutter sensor, the MT9M031, the storage node also enables using a true correlated double sampling technique to reduce readout noise to four electrons, resulting in excellent low-light performance. The combination of the effective use of an anti-reflective metal light shield in close proximity to the memory node and careful doping and potential profile design results in a high GSE.

Then say something about global shutter technology.

Curved sensor projects

Finally, it is possible to reduce spherical aberration by changing the imaging surface. An image system that couples a spherical lens with an appropriately curved sensor can have very small spherical aberration. This idea is partly inspired by the fact that the retina in many animals lines the interior of the eyeball, forming a curved sensor surface. While this is not widely used, there have been several projects to create sensors on bendable materials, including some very expensive research projects. The idea is to build these sensors for cameras with very large field of view and very high resolution across the field of view.
