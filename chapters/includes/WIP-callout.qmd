## Work in Progress
The book is still taking shape, and your feedback is an important part of the process. Suggestions of all kinds are welcome—whether it’s fixing small errors, raising bigger questions, or offering new perspectives. I’ll do my best to respond, but please keep in mind that the text will continue to change significantly over the next two years.

You can share comments through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/wandell/FISE-git/issues){target=_blank}. 

Feel free to open a new issue or join an existing discussion. To make feedback easier to address, please point to the section you have in mind—by section number or a short snippet of text. Adding a label characterizing your issue would also be helpful.
