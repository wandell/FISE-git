# Lens characterization

### Point spread and line spread functions

Shift invariant point spread.

Relationship between point spread and line spread. psf2lsf easy, but to go back you need to assume something about the circular symmetry.

### Chromatic aberration

Abbe concept. Human chromatic aberration.

### Optical Transfer Function

Relationship between OTF and PSF. Emphasis on this for a shift invariant, but not all possible cases. Local shift invariance is called aplanatic.
