# Human visual system

The purpose of many image systems is to record information about the light field and then render that information in print or on a display for viewing by a human. The components of these systems, typically for consumer photography, deliver information to the human visual system. For this reason, they must be designed with the key properties of the human visual system in mind.

This chapter describes those key human visual system properties, formulating the measurements and principles for those interested in engineering applications. I describe the measurements of human performance and the human performance metrics that have been adopted by international standards bodies or that are in widespread use in industry.

For those interested in the biological basis of these performance measurements, I provide brief call-outs within the text with some background. For a deeper dive into the biology, please consult the book Foundations of Vision [@wandellFoundationsVision1995]; that book is devoted to vision science and emphasizes neuroscience more than engineering.

The software examples included in this chapter mainly rely on the combination of ISETBio and ISETCam.

<!--# The chapters with David have a lot of the material.  -->

## The eye

Words about the whole eyeball. Separate out the physiological optics and the neural encoding in the retina.

![The human eye. Light enters through the cornea, passing through the pupil and flexible lens. In young people, the lens adjusts its shape (accommodates) to form an image on the photoreceptor layer of the retina. The retina is a 200-300 micron thick piece of neural tissue that lines the back of the eye.](/images/human/eyeball-left.png){#fig-eyeball fig-align="center" width="50%"}

![The retina lines the back of the eye. It comprises several layers and about 80 different cell types. Say more later.](/images/human/retina-periphery.png){#fig-retina-periphery width="75%" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## Physiological optics

First order approximations of the human optics. Simulations with ISETBio of maybe the Westheimer or Ijspeert functions.

### Adaptive optics

Where should the adaptive optics measurement method be? Here or FOV?

### Adaptive optics data

Adaptive optics measurements of wavefront aberrations, expressed as point spread functions.

Wavelength dependence (chromatic aberration)

Field height

Illustration with Thibos data. Artal data. ISETBio

## Photoreceptor sampling

Image showing the fovea and inhomogeneous sampling of the photoreceptor mosaics. Maybe Curcio.

Maybe the S-cone image sampling mosaic.

Adaptive optics measurements of retinal sampling

Rods, ipRGCs, too in here.

ISETBio: Examples of simulation. David also has these new measurements.

## Pattern, Time and Motion

spatial MTF - Look through modern measurements of the spatial MTF.

temporal MTF

### Image pattern metrics

SSIM. Simpler ones. Pyramid from Beau? But earlier single channel, multiple channel.

SSIM and MS-SSIM

Sharpness metrics

I forget the guy

temporal MTF. Flicker. Luminance.

## Color

<!--# What about the color matching experiment? Maybe James Clerk Maxwell mentioned but referred to FOV -->

Color representations: XYZ, luminance, chromaticity, cones

Color discrimination: ellipses

### Color metrics

CIELAB

S-CIELAB

Mark Fairchild contributions. Others?

### Computer vision metric ideas

They should be described elsewhere.

A lot of these might have been used in those directional cosine errors in Zheng's dissertation
