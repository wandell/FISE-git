# Human visual system

## Light encoding

The chapters with David have a lot of the material.  Maybe the right framing for this book.  The FOV book will be for a deeper dive.

### Adaptive optics measurement summary?
Mostly references to FOV 2025.
But some description of the retina and photoreceptors.
What about the color matching experiment?  Maybe James Clerk Maxwell goes here?

## Human perceptual measures


### Color
Color spaces
Color ellipses

### Pattern
sMTF

### Time and motion
tMTF

## Color image quality metrics
CIELAB and so forth

## CIELAB
## S-CIELAB
## Mark Fairchild stuff
## Other color metrics???

## Pattern image quality metrics
SSIM.  Simpler ones.  Pyramid from Beau?  But earlier single channel, multiple channel.

### SSIM and MS-SSIM

### Sharpness metrics
I forget the guy

### Computer vision metrics?

Note that they exist but they should go elsewhere.
