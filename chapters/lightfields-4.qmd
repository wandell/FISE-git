## Environmental light field properties {#sec-lightfield-properties}
Many image systems are designed to extract physical information from the light field, such as object size, distance, material properties, lighting conditions, or specific object types. These systems are fundamental to applications like industrial inspection, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. Even in consumer photography, estimating physical characteristics, such as the ambient lighting, is valuable.

This section explores common patterns in light fields found in nature. While these patterns vary across different contexts (underwater, aerospace, medical, nature photography), the underlying principle remains: we can identify and model these regularities to improve our image processing techniques.

### Spectral regularities
A particularly surprising, and yet profound, regularity of the environmental light field is the spectral power distribution of skylight. The sun provides a relatively stable source of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range, and this illuminates the earth's atmosphere. The light arriving at the surface passes through different amounts of atmosphere as the earth rotates. Also, the characteristics of the atmosphere, in particular its water and particle concentration, vary considerably as the weather changes.

The importance of daylight for applications from consumer photography to remote sensing made it an early object of study.

The earliest measurements of wavelength revealed the Fraunhofer lines. I should mention that. What are they and ...
