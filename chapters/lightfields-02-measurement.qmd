# Measuring light fields {#sec-lfmeasurement}

## Measuring light fields - overview

When we quantify the electromagnetic radiation, we are making a **radiometric** measurement. The amount can be specified in units of energy or the number of photons. If we measure how the amount over an array of sampled locations, we are measuring an image. The image might represent the radiation incident on a surface (such as a photograph) or encoded by a sensor array. The title of this book, foundations of **image** systems engineering, acknowledges the importance of measuring light intensity as an image is central to the field.

Many aspects of image systems engineering are framed in terms of the radiance image, rather than think about the radiation as rays or waves. For example, suppose we measure the image at two planes: the plane just prior to the optics and the plane just prior to the image sensor surface. The relationship between these two images will depend upon the optics, of course. We would like to model the transformation between these two images; this transformation characterizes the optics. 

As a second example, we may wish to know the light intensity emitted from a display and the corresponding intensity that will arrive at the eye. Or we may want to know how the intensity of radiance that is incident on a surface, and the intensity of the radiance that is reflected by the surface. These calculations do not require us to think of rays or waves. We can develop tools and models based entirely on measurements of intensities from radiance sensors.

The key principles for defining systematic measurement of image intensities are from **Radiometry**, the field that specializes in quantifying the light intensity at different positions. This section introduces basic concepts of Radiometry, along with the standard units used for quantifying the intensity. Radiometric units are an important part of image representation in the ISETCam simulation software. In @sec-optics-linear we introduce models of the intensity transformations, particularly for the important case of characterizing optics. Those radiance calculations rely on the properties of images and rely heavily on linear systems theory.

## Radiometric units

Radiometric measurements are made separately for each wavelength. For people working with light, wavelength is commonly expressed with respect to nanometers [^lightfields-measurement-1]. We quantify the radiance by measuring the amount of energy, or equivalently the number of photons, present at a location. The basic energy unit is joules per second, (watts). In the case of photons the basic unit is photons per second. Thus, in radiometry one often finds units such as (watts per nanometer) or (photons per sec per nanometer). 

[^lightfields-measurement-1]: Units of micrometers (microns, $\mu$) are commonly used by people working in the infrared studies, units of angstroms in atomic and x-ray studies, and electron volts in high-energy photon research.

We describe the energy separately for each wavelength because, in most cases, the energy at different electromagnetic wavelengths act independently: we can measure the energy at two wavelengths separately, mix the two lights, and the result is simply the sum of the individual measurements. This additivity is a critical feature of light behavior in many cases [^lightfields-measurement-2].

[^lightfields-measurement-2]: There are important and useful cases light when radiance at one wavelength evokes emissions at other wavelengths (fluorescence). There are also important cases of non-linear behavior (e.g., two-photon imaging). We discuss these when we review special instrumentation.

Radiometry defines units that are helpful for different types of geometry. The radiometric measures can be divided with respect to those from a source (radiance) and those arriving at a surface (irradiance). These can be further divided with respect to measures from a small (point) source, or from an extended surface.

Finally, adjacent to the radiometric measurements there is a set of units that summarize the impact of the radiation on the human visual system. These measurements begin with the spectral radiometry units, and they are then reduced by calculating a weighted sum across wavelengths. The weights are selected to represent (roughly) the relative visibility of each wavelength. These **photometric** units parallel the radiometric units; for example, radiance and irradiance correspond to luminance and illuminance. In this section, we will describe the radiometric quantities. 

The reader might consult [Foundations of Vision](https://wandell.github.io/FOV-1995) for more information about human vision; a summary of critical aspects of human vision for image systems engineering is presented in @sec-human. The experimental basis of photometry for the weighted sum across wavelengths -the key step to spectral radiometric quantities into photometric quantities- is explained in @sec-human-imagequality.

## Radiance from a point

@fig-radiometry illustrates the geometry of four radiometric measures. The upper left illustrates a point source. The *radiant flux* measures the total energy emitted from the point in all directions. As for all radiometric measurements, the energy (watts) is specified as a function of wavelength (watts/nm).

Often, we measure the light emitted by a point source in a particular direction, the *radiant intensity*. In that case we measure the energy within a cone of rays in a particular direction. The standard unit for angles in three-dimensions is the *steradian*, just as the radian is the standard unit for angles in two-dimensions. The radiant intensity has units of watts per steradian per nanometer (watts/sr/nm). Thus, if the measurement instrument measures energy over an angle of 0.5 steradians, we divide the measurement by 0.5. If the instrument sums over 10 nm bands, we divide the energy by 10. In this way, the radiant intensity normalizes the angle we measure to the unit steradian and per nanometer. The standard symbol for radiant intensity is $I(\lambda)$.

Because the surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4 \pi r^2$, it follows that the complete sphere surrounding a point is $4 \pi$ steradians.](images/lightfields/01-radiometry-steradian.png){#fig-steradian width="40%" fig-cap-location="bottom"}

## Radiance from a surface

In many applications we measure radiance from a patch on an extended, flat surface - such as a large light fixture with a diffuser, a wall, or a large display screen. The geometry of such a measurement accounts for two main factors illustrated in [@fig-foreshortening-sketch]. First, we must account for the area of the surface patch, as seen from the detector. For example, if the measured surface patch is a square $0.1$ meters on a side its area is $A_s = (0.1~m)^2$. The area of this patch, as seen from the detector, is foreshortened. We calculate the foreshortened area using the angle between the viewing direction and the surface normal, $\theta$, which becomes $A_s \cos(\theta) ~ m^2$. Second, we account for the size of the bundle of rays captured by the detector. We measure this size by its three-dimensional angle, $\omega ~ sr$, from a surface point that will be measured by the detector. The *radiance* combines the energy measured at the sensor ($watts/nm$) with these geometric factors. The standard symbol for spectral radiance is $L(\lambda)$. It has units of watts per nanometer per unit foreshortened-area per steradian: 

$$ 
\frac{Watts}{nm ~ \cos(\theta) ~ m^2 ~ sr}
$$

You can judge the circle sizes; I suspect the physical difference is greater your perceived size difference. (Maybe I make a set of rows of circles on a cylinder. Then you ask which physical size on, say the lowest rows, matches one of the full frontal circles.](images/lightfields/01-foreshortening.jpg){#fig-foreshortening width="80%" fig-cap-location="bottom"}

## Irradiance

Another important measurement is the radiance incident upon a surface, the *irradiance*.  This quantity is important to calculate the radiance available to an image sensor or the retina. It is also a practical measure in assessing room lighting, say how much light will arrive at a desk top. The irradiance sums the energy arriving from all directions, hence no three-dimensional angles (steradians) are specified. The irradiance measures the total energy per unit area of the of the surface. The standard symbol for irradiance is $E(\lambda)$, has units $watts/nm/m^2$.

## Radiometric units

@fig-radiometry-units is a guide to help you remember the four fundamental spectral radiometric measurements. Please note that people will sometimes report a measure of any of these radiometric quantities by summing the energy across all wavelengths. This would be called, for example, the *total radiance* or *total irradiance,* rather than the spectral radiance. I list the corresponding **photometric** measurements in @sec-human. The photometric values are also a sum across wavelengths, but weighted by the relative visual significance of the different wavelengths.

The table lists the name of the measurement, how it is used, and the International System of Units (SI) definition for each.](images/lightfields/01-radiometry-units.png){#fig-radiometry-units fig-cap-location="bottom" width="100%" fig-align="center"}

<!--# The difference between radiant intensity and radiance is a question of whether we are measuring from a point or a surface.  But as a surface patch becomes smaller and smaller, how do we know when it should be considered a point?   -->

How do we determine whether we are measuring a part of a surface or a point? The distinction between measuring a surface and a point source is not always clear-cut. Here are some principles, though none is definitive.

-   **Distance:** If the distance to the source is significantly larger than the dimensions of the source itself, it can be approximated as a point source.
-   **Solid Angle:** If the solid angle subtended by the source at the detector is very small, it can be approximated as a point source.
-   **Precision:** If high accuracy is required, it's generally better to use the radiance formula, even for small surfaces. This allows you to account for the angular distribution of the emitted radiation. If lower accuracy is sufficient, and the source can be reasonably approximated as a point source, the radiant intensity formula can be used.

These recommendations are filled with imprecision that I always try to remove. They contain words, like 'small', 'large', 'high', and 'low' because there is no fixed threshold at which a surface definitively becomes a point source. It is your decision whether to treat the source as a point. What is important is to tell people exactly what you did. If they don't like your choice, they can do it their own way. Or they can ask you - nicely - to try it another way.

After considering the four fundamental radiometric measurements presented here, it might occur to you that there is additional information we could represent. For example, it would be possible to measure the radiance of a patch of an extended surface at many different viewing angles. This would produce a function whose value depends on the two parameters, azimuth ($\alpha$) and elevation ($\beta$) that define the viewing angle. Similarly, we might decide to measure the irradiance as a function of these two incident angles. We will return to these more advanced specifications when we introduce the bidirection reflectance distribution function in @sec-properties-brdf.
