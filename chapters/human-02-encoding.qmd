## Human visual encoding overview {#sec-human-encoding-overview}

Some image systems are designed mainly to acquire information about the light field (cameras) in order to make inferences about the scene. Others are designed to capture and store information so that one might later reproduce key properties of the incident light field. The reproduction of the light field is typically intended to be viewed by a human. For this reason, the design of image reproduction systems is strongly influenced by the properties of the human vision.

We know a great deal about two aspects of the peripheral human visual system. We have many measurements of how the physiological optics of the eye transforms the incident light field into the retinal irradiance, and how this irradiance is encoded by the photoreceptors. This knowledge, derived over two centuries of vision science, can be used in many practical ways to define many features of human vision, and most clear this knowledge defines the limits of human spatial resolution and color.

There are certain obvious features of the human visual system that impact the design of image systems for reproduction. The clearest case for a match between the system and the human eye is the case of color reproduction. An image system intended for reproduction and later viewing should capture the same portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see. Missing the part of the spectrum we see would worsen the ability to create a good color reproduction; capturing parts of the spectrum we do not see would either be wasteful or potentially interfere with creating a high quality color reproduction.

The case for spatial resolution is different. It would surely be a disappointment if the image system failed to capture the scene at least as precisely as the spatial resolution of human eye. We see the scene, and we hope the camera to do at least as well. But people are generally pleased if the camera captures the scene at a finer resolution than they could see at the time. It is always possible to reduce the spatial resolution by blurring and downsampling. The increased spatial resolution will not interfere with the image rendering; it will just take more resources.

In this section, we review the anatomical and functional properties of the eye that limit how it encodes the lightfield. The properties of the eye do not account for what we see, but they do impose critical limits on what we cannot see. The way we encode wavelength and sample space within the eye represents an inescapable bottleneck on visual resolution and sensitivity. This makes measurements of the visual encoding an important part of the image systems engineering. In the next chapter, @sec-human-metrics-overviewl, I introduce various image quality metrics that are informed by these measurements. A more extensive description of the human visual encoding, including its biological substrate, is in @wandellFoundationsVision1995.

### Physiological optics

The eye includes two distinct functional systems [@fig-retina-color]. The physiological optics (cornea and lens) converts the incident light field into the optical light field, forming an image at the retina. The light sensitive cells in the retina (principally cones and rods) convert the optical light field into a neural signal that is transmitted via the optic nerve to multiple locations in the brain. There is no feedback from the brain to the retina. But there is feedback from the brain that controls body, head and eye movements, which guide how we acquire the light field. The importance of eye and head movements for the human visual system is one reason why direct comparisons between the eye and a camera are not great.

The cornea and flexible lens, together, control the transformation of the incident light field to the optical light field. Even for a fixed head and eye position, the physiological optics are dynamic: the size of the entrance pupil can change and the shape of the lens, and thus its optical power, can vary. The pupil size is not controlled willfully; it changes depending on the ambient light conditions and as well as some non-visual events in the brain. Just as the direction of gaze depends on the viewer's intention, so too does the shape of the lens. Signals sent to the ciliary muscles cause them to relax to make the lens thinner and thus focus on objects at a distance. Signals that cause the muscles to contract result in a thicker lens, enabling focus on nearby objects. The system for bringing objects into focus at the retina is called *accommodation*. As I recall from a younger age, this is a wonderful system when it works. Unfortunately, lens flexibility is lost with age - for everybody. The gradual loss of your eyes' ability to focus on nearby objects is called *presbyopia*. It's a natural, often annoying part of aging. Presbyopia usually becomes noticeable in your early to mid-40s and continues to worsen until around age 65. To compensate for this reduced flexibility, we use reading glasses. And it will happen to you.

We now have many measurements of the quality of the physiological optics. In the sections below, I will summarize these measurements and explain how to simulate how the incident light field is transformed into the retinal image by ISETBio.

### Retina

The neural tissue of the retina lines the curved surface at the back of the eye. The retina is about 5 x 5 cm, and its properties vary considerably across space. The retinal image is converted into a neural signal by a special class of neurons, the photoreceptors. The retina contains many types of specialized cells that combine into stereotypical local circuits. Multiple copies of these local circuits, but usually with different parameters, are present throughout the retina. The circuit outputs leave the retina via the optic nerve. One of the ways we can identify these circuits is that their outputs are transmitted to multiple brain regions. The circuit properties are dynamic in the sense that the circuit response to a simple stimulus, say a small flashed spot, varies with changes in the mean and variance of the retinal image.

There are some similarities between the eye and a conventional camera. For example, the optics and light sensing components are integrated into a single package, and the components are adaptive with respect to light level and focus. But there are lots of differences, as well. One major difference is that the retinal encoding does not sample the image uniformly; it is very inhomogeneous compared to modern cameras. The central human retina is specialized for the cone photoreceptors, which have small (\~ 1.5 um) apertures and are tightly packed. The size of the photoreceptor apertures increases significantly from fovea to periphery, and the receptors for nighttime vision (rods) are inserted between the cones, further increasing their center-to-center spacing. This spatial sampling is quite unlike a typical image sensor whose pixels are all of the same size. Finally, the human visual system relies on eye movements to bring regions of interest into focus at the fovea. The keep integration of eye movements is very important for such a spatially inhomogeneous system.

I will describe measurements of the optics and encoding in several sections below. These are selected to support calculations of image quality and engineering design. For more about the biology and the scientific methods used to derive these measurements, consult [@wandellFoundationsVision2024]

## The retina

The retina is a 200-300 micron thick layered structure of neural tissue that lines the back of the eye (5 cm x 5 cm). There are about 80 different cell types that can be identified through their genetic expression. Specific retinal cell types form stereotypical connections that make up specific, identifiable circuits. There are about 20 known circuits, and these are likely to account for nearly all of the circuits in the retina. The output signals from these circuits are carried on axons in the optic nerve that project to a variety of locations in the brain.

The vast majority of light-driven activity is initiated in the photoreceptors (rods and cones). The rods are the dominant source under very low light levels, and the cones are the dominant source under moderate to high light levels. The typical retinal circuit is driven by activity that starts in a local region of the photoreceptors. The same basic circuit will be present throughout the retina, tiling the photoreceptor mosaic, though the absolute size of the cells and their input regions generally vary as one measures across the retina. The size of the region increases as one measures from the highly specialized central fovea into the periphery.

### Photoreceptor spatial sampling

Maybe point mainly to the other book. Image showing the fovea and inhomogeneous sampling of the photoreceptor mosaics. Maybe Curcio. Maybe the S-cone image sampling mosaic. Adaptive optics measurements of retinal sampling Rods, ipRGCs, too in here. Other book - ISETBio: Examples of simulation. David also has these new measurements.

### Photoreceptor wavelength encoding

Encoding, not sampling.

### Adaptive optics {#sec-adaptive-optics}

The ability to measure certain properties of the optics was revolutionized by adpative optics - a method that makes real time measurements of the wavefront aberrations of the physiological optics using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. Just the measurement of the aberrations alone is useful. In addition, it has proben possible to engineer systems that correct for these aberrations in real time, and thus visualize the apertures of the photoreceptors (1-5 $\mu \text{m}$ diameter) cells in the retina. Further, using video tracking of the eye movements it has proven possible to deliver stimuli to specific, targeted photoreceptors.

First order approximations of the human optics. Simulations with ISETBio of maybe the Westheimer or Ijspeert functions. Eye models?

## Pointspread functions

Where should the adaptive optics measurement method be? Here or FOV? Adaptive optics measurements of wavefront aberrations, expressed as point spread functions. Thibos and Artal data.

### Field height dependence

Artal data. Point to ISETBio and maybe the other book.

### Ground-based telescopes {#sec-telescopes}

These same technologies can be used to look inward, within the eye, rather than outward toward the stars. Realizing this was a very important insight that continues to lead to important insights about the peripheral human visual system (@sec-human-seeing-overview).

### Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor {#sec-wavefront-sensor}

Johannes Franz Hartmann was a German astronomer working on the problem of detecting optical defects in telescope objectives. Reasoning from the ray theory of light, he measured the optical light field from a simple stimulus: an on-axis point at the focal length of the lens. In principle, the rays emerging from an ideal lens would all be parallel to the main axis. To look for deviations, he created a screen comprising an array of pinholes. If the rays were parallel, the light through the pinhole would be nicely centered behind the pinhole. If the rays were not quite parallel, the image behind the pinhole would be displaced by some distance and amount from the center. The deviations could be considered defects in the lens that could be corrected.

As I observed above, the image behind each pinhole measures the intensity of the rays incident at different angles. But in practice, a small pinhole produces a blurry spot due to diffraction. Thus Hartmann did not try to extract an image but he just estimated the central position of the blurry spot. Also, because the pinholes only let through a small amount of light, the technique was not very sensitive.

Because there is an array of these pinholes, the accumulation of pinhole images measures the rays at multiple angles at multiple positions. In principle, by performing this measurement for different wavelengths and polarizations, we sample the optical light field (@eq-lightfield-optical).

The Raskar version in which you put spots behind the lenslet array and adjust the spots to make the array uniform is kind of funny.  It is intended to measure the optical aberrations of the eye

By Henry Brougham in Edinburgh Review, an ardent admirer of Newton, criticizing Thomas Young’s Bakerian Lectures.

>  ...this paper contains nothing which deserves the name, either of experiment or of discovery, and as it is, in fact, destitute of every species of merit. We now dismiss, for the present, the feeble lucubrations of this author, in which we have searched without success for some traces of learning, acuteness, and ingenuity, that might compensate his evident deficiency in the powers of solid thinking, calm and patient investigation … 

Thomas Young wrote a reply (@young1804-reply)

 > A MAN who has a proper regard for the dignity of his own character, although his sensibility may sometimes be awakened by the unjust attacks of interested malevolence, will esteem it ingeneral more advisable to bear, in silence, the temporary effects of a short lived injury, than to suffer his own pursuits to be interrupted, in making an effort to repel the invective, and to punish the aggressor.
