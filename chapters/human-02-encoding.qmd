## Human visual encoding overview {#sec-human-encoding-overview}

When you design a digital camera, how good does it need to be? The answer depends on who you're designing it for. If the images are for a human to look at, then the camera's design must be guided by the capabilities and limits of the human eye. This simple principle has profound consequences for engineering.

Vision scientists have learned a great deal about the first stages of vision. We have excellent measurements of how the eye's optics (the cornea and lens) transform light from the world into an image on the retina, and we know how the retina's photoreceptors encode that image into neural signals. This knowledge is not just academic; it's a practical guide for designing any system that reproduces images for people.

Consider color. A camera designed for human viewing should capture the same portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see: visible light. Capturing less of the spectrum would lead to poor color reproduction. Capturing more—like infrared or ultraviolet—would be wasteful, consuming resources to record information we can't see anyway. In this sense, human wavelength sensitivity sets a clear target for camera design.

Spatial resolution presents a different challenge. It would be a disappointment if a camera failed to capture details as fine as those the human eye can resolve. We expect our photos to be at least as sharp as what we see. However, unlike with color, people are often pleased if a camera captures a scene at a *finer* resolution than the eye can perceive. We can always zoom in on the digital image to see details we might have missed. This extra information doesn't interfere with the viewing experience; it just requires more storage and processing power.

So, we have two different engineering constraints derived from human vision:

*   **Wavelength:** Human vision sets a *target range*. Capturing more is wasteful.
*   **Spatial Resolution:** Human vision sets a *minimum bar*. Capturing more can be beneficial.

In this section, we will review the key properties of the eye that define these limits. The way our visual system samples space and encodes wavelength creates fundamental bottlenecks on what we can perceive. Understanding these limits doesn't explain everything about what we see, but it tells us what we *cannot* see—essential knowledge for the field of image systems engineering.

## The Two Stages of Encoding {#sec-human-encoding-systems}

The process of converting light from the world into a neural signal that the brain can interpret happens in two main stages, as illustrated in @fig-eye-and-retina.

First, the **physiological optics**—the cornea and lens—act like a camera lens. They gather the light entering the eye and focus it to form an image on the retina. This stage transforms the light from the environment into a focused optical image.

Second, the **retina**, a thin layer of neural tissue lining the back of the eye, converts this optical image into electrical signals. This process, called transduction, is performed by specialized cells called **photoreceptors**. The signals from the photoreceptors are then processed by a complex network of other retinal neurons. The final output is sent to the brain by the **retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)**, whose axons bundle together to form the optic nerve.

:::

A key feature of the retina is that it operates as a feed-forward system; there is no direct neural feedback from the brain to the retina. This simplifies our analysis, as we can study the retina's input-output relationship without accounting for top-down signals from other brain regions—a luxury not often afforded when studying the nervous system.

However, the brain also sends signals to the eye that control the size of the pupil and the optical power of the lens. The brain also provides an important indirect form of feedback by controlling eye, head, and body positions. These signals determine which part of the visual world is projected onto the retina. All of these signals are essential for seeing.

## Physiological optics
The cornea and the flexible lens work together to focus light, forming an image on the retina, as shown in @fig-physiological-optics. This optical system is dynamic, constantly adjusting both the amount of light it lets in and its focal point.

The amount of light entering the eye is controlled by the **pupil**, the aperture that can dilate (open) to about 8 mm in diameter in dim light or constrict (close) to about 2 mm in bright light. This change in area adjusts the light intake by a factor of about 16 (or 1.2 log units). While significant, this is a small adjustment compared to the vast range of light levels in the natural world, which can span over 10 log units. The pupil's size changes automatically in response to light, but it is also influenced by cognitive and emotional states, such as arousal or mental effort.

</figcaption>
:::

The eye changes its focus through a process called **accommodation**. Neural signals control the ciliary muscles, which are connected to the lens. To focus on distant objects, the ciliary muscles contract, which increases the diameter of the ring they form and pulls on the zonule fibers, flattening the lens. To focus on nearby objects, the muscles relax, allowing the lens to return to its natural, more rounded shape, which increases its optical power.

This remarkable flexibility is not permanent. With age, the lens gradually stiffens, reducing its ability to change shape. This condition, known as **presbyopia**, makes it difficult to focus on near objects. It typically becomes noticeable in one's early to mid-40s and is a natural part of aging, commonly corrected with reading glasses.  It happens to all of us.

## Retina
Since the early 2000s, vision scientists have been able to measure the quality of the physiological optics. In the sections below, I will summarize these measurements and the techniques that were invented to make them.  I will also explain how to simulate how the incident light field is transformed into the retinal image using ISETBio. For me, it is important to understand these optics in terms of the photoreceptor sampling array.  Knowing that an image is spread over 5 microns can mean one thing if the photoreceptors are sample every 1 micron and something quite different if the photoreceptors sample every 10 microns.  So before we talk about the physiological optics, let's consider the retina and particularly the photoreceptor mosaic.

The retina is aabout 150-350 microns thick, and it covers the back of the eye over an area of about (5 cm x 5 cm). It is made up of three main layers structure of neural tissue that lines. There are about 80 different cell types that can be identified through their genetic expression, responses to light, and anatomical form. The retinal cells form stereotypical connections, which we call retinal circuits. We believe that there are about 20 circuits. The circuit outputs, carried on the retinal ganglion cell axons in the optic nerve, project to a variety of locations in the brain.

The vast majority of light-driven activity is initiated in the photoreceptors (rods and cones). The rods are the dominant source under very low light levels, and the cones are the dominant source under moderate to high light levels. The typical retinal circuit is driven by activity that starts in a local region of the photoreceptors. The same basic circuit will be present throughout the retina, tiling the photoreceptor mosaic, though the absolute size of the cells and their input regions generally vary as one measures across the retina. The size of the region increases as one measures from the highly specialized central fovea into the periphery.

There is one important and interesting exception, only recently discovered.  There exists a class of retinal ganglion cells that contain a light sensitive pigment.  These cells, called the **intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs)** absorb photons and respond to the presence or absence of light.  There are not a lot of these cells, but their outputs are important for circadian rhythms.  They may also have an impact on other aspects of vision - even perception.

<!-- The Massey 2006 retinal anatomy paper has lots of great images.  Use that as a resource!  Some better than the ones here. -->

DIC optics refers to **Differential Interference Contrast microscopy**.

It's a type of optical microscopy technique that enhances the contrast in unstained, transparent specimens, like the layers of a retina, by making features visible that would otherwise be nearly invisible in a brightfield microscope.

### How DIC Optics Work

DIC microscopy converts gradients in specimen thickness or refractive index (which naturally occur at the boundaries of structures like cell layers, membranes, and organelles) into differences in light intensity (contrast) that the human eye or a camera can detect.

1.  **Light Manipulation:** It uses specialized optical components, primarily **polarizers** and **Nomarski prisms** (or Wollaston prisms), to split a single beam of light into two beams that are slightly offset from each other.
2.  **Phase Shift:** These two beams pass through adjacent regions of the specimen. Since the specimen has a varying refractive index (e.g., one beam passes through a cell membrane, the other through the surrounding cytoplasm), the light waves emerge with a slight **phase difference**.
3.  **Interference:** The beams are then recombined. Due to the phase difference, they **interfere** with each other. This interference creates a high-contrast, pseudo-three-dimensional relief image, making structures like the cell layers and fine details mentioned in the caption (e.g., cone pedicles) much more distinct and easier to observe without the need for staining. 

In the context of the figure caption, using DIC optics allowed the researchers to clearly delineate the layered structure of the macaque retina—the **plexiform layers** and the **nuclear layers (ONL, INL, ganglion cell layer)**—in a fresh or relatively unstained preparation.

## Cone spatial sampling

Define the inner and outer segment of a cone photoreceptor here.  Explain that light is captured at the aperture formed by the opening at the inner segment.  THe light does not leave the cell once it enters.  

![https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780121852795500078#f20 or baylor or https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216804721_Photoreceptor_Phosphodiesterase_PDE6_A_G-Protein-Activated_PDE_Regulating_Visual_Excitation_in_Rod_and_Cone_Photoreceptor_Cells/figures?lo=1](images/human/02-encoding/photoreceptor-anatomy.png){#fig-photoreceptor-anatomy width="50%"}

The regularity of the cone sampling mosaic in the central retina was a surprise. William Miller, at Yale, led the lab that was the first to crisply show it the dense packing. Over small chunks of the primate retina the packing is quite dense (@fig-inner-segment-miller), in a spatial arrangement called a triangular sampling grid.  It is also called a hexagonal packing scheme because each cell is surrounded by six other cells. In the central fovea, the inner segment apertures are about 1.5 microns in diameter, which is only 2-3 times the wavelength of light. The Airy disk diameter for a 550 nm light, given an f/# of 17mm/3mm or about 5.6 is 3 microns? [@eq-airydisk1].

The picture above doesn't show the different cone types.  These images do.  The S-cone spatial sampling is quite different from the other types.

### Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor {#sec-wavefront-sensor}

Johannes Franz Hartmann was a German astronomer working on the problem of detecting optical defects in telescope objectives. Reasoning from the ray theory of light, he measured the optical light field from a simple stimulus: an on-axis point at the focal length of the lens. In principle, the rays emerging from an ideal lens would all be parallel to the main axis. To look for deviations, he created a screen comprising an array of pinholes. If the rays were parallel, the light through the pinhole would be nicely centered behind the pinhole. If the rays were not quite parallel, the image behind the pinhole would be displaced by some distance and amount from the center. The deviations could be considered defects in the lens that could be corrected.

As I observed above, the image behind each pinhole measures the intensity of the rays incident at different angles. But in practice, a small pinhole produces a blurry spot due to diffraction. Thus Hartmann did not try to extract an image but he just estimated the central position of the blurry spot. Also, because the pinholes only let through a small amount of light, the technique was not very sensitive.

Because there is an array of these pinholes, the accumulation of pinhole images measures the rays at multiple angles at multiple positions. In principle, by performing this measurement for different wavelengths and polarizations, we sample the optical light field (@eq-lightfield-optical).

### Ground-based telescopes {#sec-telescopes}

These same technologies can be used to look inward, within the eye, rather than outward toward the stars. Realizing this was a very important insight that continues to lead to important insights about the peripheral human visual system (@sec-human-seeing-overview).

### Adaptive optics {#sec-adaptive-optics}
Where should the adaptive optics measurement method be? Here or FOV? Adaptive optics measurements of wavefront aberrations, expressed as point spread functions. Thibos and Artal data.

The ability to measure certain properties of the optics was revolutionized by adpative optics - a method that makes real time measurements of the wavefront aberrations of the physiological optics using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. Just the measurement of the aberrations alone is useful. In addition, it has proben possible to engineer systems that correct for these aberrations in real time, and thus visualize the apertures of the photoreceptors (1-5 $\mu \text{m}$ diameter) cells in the retina. Further, using video tracking of the eye movements it has proven possible to deliver stimuli to specific, targeted photoreceptors.

## Photoreceptor spatial sampling

Maybe point mainly to the other book. Image showing the fovea and inhomogeneous sampling of the photoreceptor mosaics. Maybe Curcio. Maybe the S-cone image sampling mosaic. Adaptive optics measurements of retinal sampling Rods, ipRGCs, too in here. Other book - ISETBio: Examples of simulation. David also has these new measurements.

## Photoreceptor wavelength encoding

The neural tissue of the retina lines the curved surface at the back of the eye. The retina is about 5 x 5 cm, and its properties vary considerably across space. The retinal image is converted into a neural signal by a special class of neurons, the photoreceptors. The retina contains many types of specialized cells that combine into stereotypical local circuits. Multiple copies of these local circuits, but usually with different parameters, are present throughout the retina. The circuit outputs leave the retina via the optic nerve. One of the ways we can identify these circuits is that their outputs are transmitted to multiple brain regions. The circuit properties are dynamic in the sense that the circuit response to a simple stimulus, say a small flashed spot, varies with changes in the mean and variance of the retinal image.

There are some similarities between the eye and a conventional camera. For example, the optics and light sensing components are integrated into a single package, and the components are adaptive with respect to light level and focus. But there are lots of differences, as well. One major difference is that the retinal encoding does not sample the image uniformly; it is very inhomogeneous compared to modern cameras. The central human retina is specialized for the cone photoreceptors, which have small (\~ 1.5 um) apertures and are tightly packed. The size of the photoreceptor apertures increases significantly from fovea to periphery, and the receptors for nighttime vision (rods) are inserted between the cones, further increasing their center-to-center spacing. This spatial sampling is quite unlike a typical image sensor whose pixels are all of the same size. Finally, the human visual system relies on eye movements to bring regions of interest into focus at the fovea. The keep integration of eye movements is very important for such a spatially inhomogeneous system.

I will describe measurements of the optics and encoding in several sections below. These are selected to support calculations of image quality and engineering design. For more about the biology and the scientific methods used to derive these measurements, consult [@wandellFoundationsVision2024]

## Retinal prostheses

Now that we know so much about the retinal encoding, the Palanker project would fit well.

THe Chichilnisky project gets thrown in at the end as next generation.  Palanker fits well with the cones going forward.  The Chichilnisky project fits well with motivating why we want to know what the retinal circuitry does so we address diseases when the bipolar cells (inner nuclear layer) are damaged.
