# Light field properties {#sec-lightfield-properties}
Many image systems are designed to with the goal of extracting information about the scene from the light field. These systems might be designed to identify an object and its properties, such as size, distance, and material properties. These systems are fundamental to applications like industrial inspection, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. Even in consumer photography applications that simply reproduce the light field, estimating physical characteristics - such as the ambient lighting - can be useful.

In many image systems applications, the information obtained by the camera (or eye) is insufficient to determine a unique solution of size, distance, or material. Many different scenes or objects might have produced the measured image. There is a general principle that applies to these under constrained situations. The idea, often attributed to Thomas Bayes, is quite simple. If many potential solutions exist to a problem, Bayes' Rule tells us to select the most likely one.  Seems pretty obvious, no?

The hard part, of course, is how do we know which light field is the most likely one.  We may not always have this information, but sometimes we do.  There are some empirical regularities  that make some light fields far more likely than others. In this section we describe some regularities that have been reported about the spectral (wavelength) properties and the spatial properties in natural images. In special circumstances, such as medical imaging or industrial inspection conditions, the regularities may be much more constrained. How to specify the regularities and take advantage of them will be a recurring theme as we describe various systems.

## Spectral regularities in natural scenes

### The sky
Radiation from the sun is the main source that produces the environmental light field in natural scenes. The sun itself provides a relatively stable source of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range. The sun's radiation passes through the earth's atmosphere which can have a wide variety of characteristics depending on the weather.  The major variation is due to differences in water and particle concentration. Also, depending on the time of day, the amount of atmosphere between the sun and the surface varies. 

The importance of skylight made it an early object of study.  Early on, physicists noticed that the light arriving at the surface has several reliable features, including what they labeled the Fraunhofer lines.  (What are these?  Callout about their identification.  I think these are absorptions of the sunlight by water and they show up as dimming at certain wavelengths relative to nearby wavelengths)?  These location of these lines are sufficiently dependable that scientists could use the presence of these lines in their laboratory data to calibrate their instruments for spectral measurements.  

Are there Fraunhofer lines in the visible spectrum?  Not that I know of.
