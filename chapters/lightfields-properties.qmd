# Light field properties {#sec-lightfield-properties}
Many image systems are designed to with the goal of extracting information about the scene from the light field. These systems might be designed to identify an object and its properties, such as size, distance, and material properties. These systems are fundamental to applications like industrial inspection, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. Even in consumer photography applications that simply reproduce the light field, estimating physical characteristics - such as the ambient lighting - can be useful.

In many image systems applications, the information obtained by the camera (or eye) is insufficient to determine a unique solution of size, distance, or material. Many different scenes or objects might have produced the measured image. There is a general principle that applies to these under constrained situations. The idea, often attributed to Thomas Bayes, is quite simple. If many potential solutions exist to a problem, Bayes' Rule tells us to select the most likely one.  Seems pretty obvious, no?

The hard part, of course, is how do we know which light field is the most likely one.  We may not always have this information, but sometimes we do.  There are some empirical regularities  that make some light fields far more likely than others. In this section we describe some regularities that have been reported about the spectral (wavelength) properties and the spatial properties in natural images. In special circumstances, such as medical imaging or industrial inspection conditions, the regularities may be much more constrained. How to specify the regularities and take advantage of them will be a recurring theme as we describe various systems.

## Spectral regularities in natural scenes
A particularly surprising, and yet profound, regularity of the environmental light field is the spectral power distribution of skylight. The sun provides a relatively stable source of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range, and this illuminates the earth's atmosphere. The light arriving at the surface passes through different amounts of atmosphere as the earth rotates. Also, the characteristics of the atmosphere, in particular its water and particle concentration, vary considerably as the weather changes.

The importance of daylight for applications from consumer photography to remote sensing made it an early object of study.
