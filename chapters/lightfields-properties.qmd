# Light field properties {#sec-lightfield-properties}
Many image systems are designed to extract quantitative information about the scene. These systems might be designed to identify an object and its properties, such as its size, distance, and material. These systems are fundamental to applications like industrial inspection, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. Even in consumer photography applications, whose primary mission is to reproduce the light field, estimating scene physical characteristics - such as the ambient lighting - can be useful.

In many image systems applications, the information obtained by the camera (or eye) is insufficient to determine a unique solution of size, distance, or material. The measurement is under constrained, so that many different scenes or objects might have produced the measured image. There is a general principle that applies to these situations, often attributed to Thomas Bayes, is quite simple. If many potential solutions exist to a problem, Bayes' Rule tells us to select the most likely one.  Seems pretty obvious, no?

The hard part, of course, is how to know which answer is the most likely one.  We do not always have this information, but sometimes we do.  For example, we might know that there are some regularities in the world that make some spectral light fields far more likely than others. In this section we describe some regularities about the spectral (wavelength) and spatial properties in natural images. In certain circumstances, such as medical imaging or industrial inspection conditions, the regularities may be very significant. How to specify the regularities and take advantage of them will be a recurring theme as we describe various image systems.

The sun is the Earth's main source of radiation. The solar radiation itself is relatively stable in the visible range. But as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere, the radiation is substantially altered by particles and moisture.  Further, depending on the time of day the radiation may have to travel longer distance through the atmosphere.

The importance of skylight made it an early object of study.  Physicists noticed that sun light arriving at the Earth's surface has several distinct features.  In 1814 Fraunhofer noted several particularly dark lines in the solar spectrum.  As light from the Sun's hot, dense interior (photosphere) passes through its cooler outer layers (chromosphere and corona), atoms and ions absorb specific wavelengths of light corresponding to their electronic transitions.  

In addition, there are significant effects as  absorptions of the sunlight by water and they show up as dimming at certain wavelengths relative to nearby wavelengths)?  These location of these lines are sufficiently dependable that scientists could use the presence of these lines in their laboratory data to calibrate their instruments for spectral measurements.  

Are there Fraunhofer lines in the visible spectrum?  Not that I know of.
