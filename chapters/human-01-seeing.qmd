## Seeing overview {#sec-human-seeing-overview}
The science of human vision—spanning behavior, perception, and neuroscience—is fascinating, and many aspects of human vision are important for image systems design. This is the topic of my earlier book, [Foundations of Vision](https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu) (@Wandell1995-FOV), which I plan to update after this book matures.

This chapter and along with @sec-human-encoding-overview and @sec-human-metrics-overview cover topics in human vision that are immediately relevant to image systems engineering. I cover the limits of spatial, temporal, and wavelength encoding by the eye, along with a variety of practical, computable image quality metrics. These metrics are widely used by engineers, and the principles behind them are well-established. We will also explore how to improve upon these tools.

Before we tackle those topics, in this chapter I take just a few pages to explore the question of what it means *to see*. As mentioned earlier (@sec-vision-inference), Hermann von Helmholtz was among the first to argue that we do not perceive the world directly. Instead, what we see is an inference based on the portion of the light field our eyes encode.

When Helmholtz proposed this, he challenged the prevailing belief that introspection was a valid scientific method for understanding visual interpretation. He argued that we are largely unaware of the underlying neural processing, which he termed *unconscious inferences*. This term was not an explanation of the process itself, but a counterargument to the idea that we can understand vision simply by thinking about our own perceptions.

The key takeaway is that our percepts are essentially educated guesses about the state of the world. The term *inference* is a sophisticated way of saying we are making guesses, not logical *deductions*. How do we understand the principles behind these guesses? A crucial source of insight comes from **visual illusions**. One might argue, as Helmholtz did, that all vision is an illusion. The instances where our visual guesses are incorrect are particularly instructive, as they help reveal the principles that also guide our correct perceptions. This section uses illusions to illustrate this point, ensuring we don't let technical details obscure the [Big Picture](https://youtu.be/N0xjPZs0C6g?si=bDlSuwbgW74kpKEJ).

Each illusion presented here demonstrates a principle the visual system uses to infer the state of the world. I leave the philosophical debate about whether these are true illusions or simply compelling demonstrations to others[^debate]. I have selected them for what they reveal about the principles embedded in our visual inferences. For a more extensive collection, I highly recommend the work of [Akiyoshi Kitaoka](https://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html) and the remarkable entries in the [Illusion of the Year](https://illusionoftheyear.com/) contest.

[^debate]:  Yes, I have had people I respect challenge whether some of these are really illusions or not.

### The world is three-dimensional

The two tabletops in this picture are the same shape and size in the 2D image. (You can verify this by copying one, rotating it, and placing it over the other.) Yet one looks long and narrow while the other looks short and wide.

Why the strong difference? Your visual system automatically interprets the flat image as a projection of a 3D scene. It applies implicit corrections for depth and slant (foreshortening) suggested by the table legs, the implied perspective, and the contour orientations. Those same corrections that usually help you perceive true 3D structure now drive the illusion.

If we could walk around the actual (imagined) 3D scene the image depicts, the two physical tabletops producing those projections would almost certainly differ. The exact 2D match in the picture is an artifact of viewpoint and Shepard’s careful drawing, not something you normally notice. What you consciously experience is the most plausible 3D interpretation, not the raw 2D geometry falling on the retina.

![R.N. Shepard's illusion: Turning the Tables.](images/human/01-seeing/Shepard-turning-tables.png)

Shepard’s illusion reminds us: for everyday vision, judging the 2D retinal (or image) shape in isolation is difficult. You see an inference about 3D structure, not the un-interpreted projection.

### Expectations of likely shapes

Richard Gregory's 'Hollow Mask' illusion is a powerful extension of the "Turning the Tables" demonstration.  In this illusion the mask is genuinely three-dimensional, having the same shape as a face. The illusion arises because when you see the inside of the mask the three-dimensional shape is quite unlike the typical three-dimensional shape of a face -the mask is hollow-. Yet, the mask appears to have the three-dimensional structure one would expect of a real face, with the nose nearest you. You do see a three-dimensional shape, but it is the likely (and wrong) shape.

Equally interesting is the how we see the motion of the rotating mask. The interpretation of the depth is wrong. To explain the stimulus on your retina, your brain makes a second wrong interpretation:  the mask appears to be rotating opposite to its true direction.

The Hollow Mask Illusion informs us that we are deeply biased about the three-dimensional shape of certain objects. Apparently, we expect to see noses closer than foreheads. Given the chance, we force that interpretation and we then reinterpret other features (the motion) to make them consistent.

### Regional comparisons

The three images presented below all inform us that we make even the simplest judgments, such as the brightness of a square, by taking into account the image context. Kitaoka's demonstration shows that the local contrast of the squares matter more than their absolute level.  Adelson's demonstration suggests one reason for this:  we are striving to see surface reflectance.  Cast shadows change the absolute intensity from a surface and this makes the absolute level unreliable about the surface reflectance.  Lotto and Purves glam up the Adelson version with a very realistic rendering.

### Edges matter
It is rather surprising that the impact of the local edge contrast spreads quite widely across space.  In the classic Cornsweet illusion we see that the two squares appear to be different across their whole extent.  They have the same intensity, but we see them as different  based on just the contrast information at the edge.

The spreading over space is made very clear in this version from Daikin and Bex.  The large image areas all have the same intensity.  Some regions appear lighter than others only because of the contrast at the edge, between the regions.  Thus, the local information spreads to brightness judgments across quite substantial regions of the visual field. Try moving further and closer to the image, so that these regions come to occupy quite a large part of the visual field.  You will see that the illusion persists.

### 2nd order contrast?

I am looking for a fundamental 2nd order contrast illusion.

2nd order contrast, contrast of the contrast, should appear somewhere in the new FOV and possibly here.

### Motion, pattern, and color combine

Not sure

### Seeing without light

Something about Craik, Newton, Brindley personal experiments?  Entopic phenomena.

TODO: Remember the Newton bodnick pressure on the eye. https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03975/21 a tip until he saw ‘several white darke and colored circles. Which circles were plainest when I continued to rub my eye with the point of the bodkin.’ Yet when he held both eyes and bodkin still, the circles would begin to fade. Was light a manifestation of pressure, then? Almost as recklessly, he stared with one eye at the sun, reflected in a looking glass, for as long as he could bear. He sensed that color—perhaps more than any of the other qualities of things—depends on imagination and fantasy and invention. He looked away at a dark wall and saw circles of color. There was a motion of spirits in his eye. These slowly decayed and finally vanished. Were they real or phantasm? Could such colors ever be real, like the colors he had learned to make from crushed berries or sheep’s blood? After looking at the sun he seemed to perceive light objects as red and dark objects as blue.” (Gleick, James. Isaac Newton. New York: Pantheon Books, 2003:61–2.)

From Gemini.
Around 1665 or 1666, a young Isaac Newton, in his pursuit of understanding how the eye perceives light, took a "bodkin" (a blunt needle, often used for piercing fabric or threading ribbons) and very carefully inserted it between his eye and the bone of his eye socket, pushing it as close to the back of his eye as he could.

He then pressed on his eyeball with the end of the bodkin, deliberately altering its curvature. As he did this, he observed and meticulously recorded the visual phenomena that appeared. He noted "several white, dark, & coloured circles" which were most vivid when he continued to rub his eye with the bodkin, but would fade if he held it still.

He also varied the conditions, performing the experiment in both a light room (with eyes shut, so some light would get through) and a very dark room, observing different patterns and colors of circles and spots.

Newton's aims and observations:

Newton's motivation for this extreme self-experiment was to explore the origins of color perception. He was trying to determine if color was an external property of light itself, or if it was, in part, a product of the eye's internal mechanisms and the pressure applied to it.

His observations, though seemingly odd and somewhat disturbing, were aimed at understanding how the physical manipulation of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) could produce visual sensations even in the absence of external light. He noted that the colors and patterns he saw changed depending on the pressure and how the eye was deformed.

While this particular experiment didn't directly lead to his groundbreaking discoveries about the spectrum of light (which came from his famous prism experiments), it was part of his broader, often daring, inquiry into optics and vision. It highlights Newton's extreme dedication and willingness to use himself as a subject in his scientific pursuits.
