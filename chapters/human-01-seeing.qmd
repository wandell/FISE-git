## Seeing overview {#sec-human-seeing-overview}
The science of human vision -spanning behavior to neuroscience- is fascinating and huge.  I wrote [a book](https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu) covering the foundations of vision (@Wandell1995-FOV); I plan to update that book after the writing for this one has matured. There is no need to duplicate that writing here.  Instead, this book covers only those aspects of human vision that are directly relevant to image systems engineering. I consider these topics to be the limits of spatial, temporal and wavelength encoding, and a range of image quality metrics. I chose these topics because there are computable models that engineers can use in all of those domains, and I believe that the insights surrounding the encoding are firmly established.

There is only one area that I am going to break this rule: it is the question of what it means to "see". We often quote Helmholtz on this topic (@sec-vision-inference). He forcefully observed that we do not see the world directly, but rather our perception is an inference that we draw from the measurements by encoding a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. We are not generally aware of these inferences, and thus Helmholtz referred to these processes as *unconscious inference*. The important point is that our perception is a set of (usually good) guesses from partial information. Nothing illustrates this fact quite as clearly, or pleasurably, as the phenomena we call **visual illusions**.  Helmholtz might (rightly) say that all of vision is an illusion. This section, which parallels the chapter entitled 'Seeing' in @Wandell1995-FOV, uses illusions to make this point again.

The illusions in this section each illustrate a principle that the visual system uses to draw an inference about the world. Whether they are illusions, or simply interesting demonstrations, is something I will leave to the philosophers[^debate].  I choose them because they are informative.

[^debate]:  Yes, I have had people I respect challenge whether some of these are really illusions or not.

### The world is three-dimensional

R.N. Shepard turning the tables.

### Certain expectations are 

R.L. Gregory the hollow mask

### Global context matters

Ted Adelson Checker Shadow illusion.  Maybe Lotto version also. Maybe the Dan Kerstein shadow?

### Local context matters

Daikin.  Cornsweet Craik O'Brien?

### Motion, pattern, and color combine

Not sure

### Something about Craik, Newton, Brindley personal experiments?

TODO: Remember the Newton bodnick pressure on the eye. https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03975/21 a tip until he saw ‘several white darke and colored circles. Which circles were plainest when I continued to rub my eye with the point of the bodkin.’ Yet when he held both eyes and bodkin still, the circles would begin to fade. Was light a manifestation of pressure, then? Almost as recklessly, he stared with one eye at the sun, reflected in a looking glass, for as long as he could bear. He sensed that color—perhaps more than any of the other qualities of things—depends on imagination and fantasy and invention. He looked away at a dark wall and saw circles of color. There was a motion of spirits in his eye. These slowly decayed and finally vanished. Were they real or phantasm? Could such colors ever be real, like the colors he had learned to make from crushed berries or sheep’s blood? After looking at the sun he seemed to perceive light objects as red and dark objects as blue.” (Gleick, James. Isaac Newton. New York: Pantheon Books, 2003:61–2.)

From Gemini.
Around 1665 or 1666, a young Isaac Newton, in his pursuit of understanding how the eye perceives light, took a "bodkin" (a blunt needle, often used for piercing fabric or threading ribbons) and very carefully inserted it between his eye and the bone of his eye socket, pushing it as close to the back of his eye as he could.

He then pressed on his eyeball with the end of the bodkin, deliberately altering its curvature. As he did this, he observed and meticulously recorded the visual phenomena that appeared. He noted "several white, dark, & coloured circles" which were most vivid when he continued to rub his eye with the bodkin, but would fade if he held it still.

He also varied the conditions, performing the experiment in both a light room (with eyes shut, so some light would get through) and a very dark room, observing different patterns and colors of circles and spots.

Newton's aims and observations:

Newton's motivation for this extreme self-experiment was to explore the origins of color perception. He was trying to determine if color was an external property of light itself, or if it was, in part, a product of the eye's internal mechanisms and the pressure applied to it.

His observations, though seemingly odd and somewhat disturbing, were aimed at understanding how the physical manipulation of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) could produce visual sensations even in the absence of external light. He noted that the colors and patterns he saw changed depending on the pressure and how the eye was deformed.

While this particular experiment didn't directly lead to his groundbreaking discoveries about the spectrum of light (which came from his famous prism experiments), it was part of his broader, often daring, inquiry into optics and vision. It highlights Newton's extreme dedication and willingness to use himself as a subject in his scientific pursuits.
