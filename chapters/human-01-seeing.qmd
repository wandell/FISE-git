## Seeing overview {#sec-human-seeing-overview}
The science of human vision—spanning behavior, perception, and neuroscience—is fascinating and highly significant for image systems engineers. This book does not aim for comprehensive coverage of vision science; that material is covered in my earlier book, [Foundations of Vision](https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu) (@Wandell1995-FOV), which I plan to update after this book matures.

Instead, this chapter focuses on aspects of human vision immediately relevant to image systems engineering. We will cover the limits of spatial, temporal, and wavelength encoding by the eye, along with a variety of practical, computable image quality metrics. These metrics are widely used by engineers, and the principles behind them are well-established. We will also explore how to improve upon these tools.

I will, however, deviate slightly to explore the question of what it means to "see." As mentioned earlier (@sec-vision-inference), Hermann von Helmholtz was among the first to argue that we do not perceive the world directly. Instead, what we "see" is an inference based on the portion of the light field our eyes encode.

When Helmholtz proposed this, he challenged the prevailing belief that introspection was a valid scientific method for understanding visual interpretation. He argued that we are largely unaware of the underlying neural processing, which he termed *unconscious inferences*. This term was not an explanation of the process itself, but a counterargument to the idea that we can understand vision simply by thinking about our own perceptions.

The key takeaway is that our percepts are essentially educated guesses about the state of the world. The term *inference* is a sophisticated way of saying we are making guesses, not logical *deductions*. How do we understand the principles behind these guesses? A crucial source of insight comes from **visual illusions**. One might argue, as Helmholtz did, that all vision is an illusion. The instances where our visual guesses are incorrect are particularly instructive, as they help reveal the principles that also guide our correct perceptions. This section uses illusions to illustrate this point, ensuring we don't let technical details obscure the [Big Picture](https://youtu.be/N0xjPZs0C6g?si=bDlSuwbgW74kpKEJ).

Each illusion presented here demonstrates a principle the visual system uses to infer the state of the world. I leave the philosophical debate about whether these are true illusions or simply compelling demonstrations to others[^debate]. I have selected them for what they reveal about the principles embedded in our visual inferences. For a more extensive collection, I highly recommend the work of [Akiyoshi Kitaoka](https://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html) and the remarkable entries in the [Illusion of the Year](https://illusionoftheyear.com/) contest.

[^debate]:  Yes, I have had people I respect challenge whether some of these are really illusions or not.

### The world is three-dimensional

![R.N. Shepard's illusion is called Turning the Tables. As measured in the image, the two table tops are the same. This is just an accident, however, of the way they are projected into the image.  If we could measure them in the three-dimensional form they would not be the same.  Your visual system nearly inescapably interprets images as three-dimensional objects. The table tops don't look the same, even though they are the same in the page.](images/human/01-seeing/Shepard-turning-tables.png)

### Expectations of likely shapes

![R.L. Gregory the hollow mask demonstration.  The mask is rotating on a stick.  As you see the inside of the mask, it appears to have the three-dimensional structure one would expect of a face, with the nose nearest you. Because it is not, encoding conflicts with the motion. Hence, the mask appears to be rotating in a direction opposite to its true direction. There are certain objects that are deeply biased to be seen in a certain way -face have their noses pointing towards you!- by the visual system.](images/human/01-seeing/Chaplin.wmv.mp4)

### Regional comparisons

# Local contrast
![We make even simple judgments, such as the brightness of a square, with respect to their context.  The absolute level is not as important. This tab illustrates the principle using a version from [Akiyoshi Kitaoka.  The squares labeled A and B have the same absolute level.  But the shading across the checkerboard pattern makes it appear that the A square is darker than the B square.](https://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html)](images/human/01-seeing/local-contrast.png){#fig-basic-contrast width="70%"}

# Adelson: Checkered shadow
![Ted Adelson created this illusion to showing why the local contrast is a good basis for judging surface brightness.  He gives us a physical reason for the shading, a cast shadow.  Again the squares labeled A and B are the same intensity.](images/human/01-seeing/Adelson-shadow-checkers.png){#fig-adelson-contrast width="70%"}

# Lotto and Purves
![Beau Lotto and Dale Purves glammed it up with this very compelling and striking image. The two tiles on the floor, one that appears white and the other dark gray, are the same.  One is in shadow, andthe other directly illuminated. Local contrast is informative about the surface property. The visual system wants you to see the surface, not the number of photons from the surface. Cite their book here.](images/human/01-seeing/Lotto-illumination.png){#fig-lotto-contrast width="70%"}

### 2nd order contrast?

I am looking for a fundamental 2nd order contrast illusion.

<!-- 
2nd order contrast, contrast of the contrast, should appear somewhere in the new FOV and possibly here.

### Motion, pattern, and color combine

Not sure

### Seeing without light

Something about Craik, Newton, Brindley personal experiments?  Entopic phenomena.

TODO: Remember the Newton bodnick pressure on the eye. https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03975/21 a tip until he saw ‘several white darke and colored circles. Which circles were plainest when I continued to rub my eye with the point of the bodkin.’ Yet when he held both eyes and bodkin still, the circles would begin to fade. Was light a manifestation of pressure, then? Almost as recklessly, he stared with one eye at the sun, reflected in a looking glass, for as long as he could bear. He sensed that color—perhaps more than any of the other qualities of things—depends on imagination and fantasy and invention. He looked away at a dark wall and saw circles of color. There was a motion of spirits in his eye. These slowly decayed and finally vanished. Were they real or phantasm? Could such colors ever be real, like the colors he had learned to make from crushed berries or sheep’s blood? After looking at the sun he seemed to perceive light objects as red and dark objects as blue.” (Gleick, James. Isaac Newton. New York: Pantheon Books, 2003:61–2.)

From Gemini.
Around 1665 or 1666, a young Isaac Newton, in his pursuit of understanding how the eye perceives light, took a "bodkin" (a blunt needle, often used for piercing fabric or threading ribbons) and very carefully inserted it between his eye and the bone of his eye socket, pushing it as close to the back of his eye as he could.

He then pressed on his eyeball with the end of the bodkin, deliberately altering its curvature. As he did this, he observed and meticulously recorded the visual phenomena that appeared. He noted "several white, dark, & coloured circles" which were most vivid when he continued to rub his eye with the bodkin, but would fade if he held it still.

He also varied the conditions, performing the experiment in both a light room (with eyes shut, so some light would get through) and a very dark room, observing different patterns and colors of circles and spots.

Newton's aims and observations:

Newton's motivation for this extreme self-experiment was to explore the origins of color perception. He was trying to determine if color was an external property of light itself, or if it was, in part, a product of the eye's internal mechanisms and the pressure applied to it.

His observations, though seemingly odd and somewhat disturbing, were aimed at understanding how the physical manipulation of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) could produce visual sensations even in the absence of external light. He noted that the colors and patterns he saw changed depending on the pressure and how the eye was deformed.

While this particular experiment didn't directly lead to his groundbreaking discoveries about the spectrum of light (which came from his famous prism experiments), it was part of his broader, often daring, inquiry into optics and vision. It highlights Newton's extreme dedication and willingness to use himself as a subject in his scientific pursuits.
