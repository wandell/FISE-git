# Image processing {#sec-imgprocessing}
To this point, we have considered the environmental light field [@sec-lightfields], how it is measured by the optics [@sec-optics], and how it is then converted into electrons at each pixel [@sec-sensors]. We have also considered how the visual system would capture the same light field.  

The first part of this chapter on image processing describes the steps that converts the data measured by the sensor into a signal that can be viewed by a person.

It seems as if we should have display go first so we can do it.  Or we might just assume that people know displays are typically RGB and hope for the best?  

Also, the human section on color might include some minimal display description that we could use here as the basic display model, with more advanced displays to come later, in the chapter @sec-displays.
