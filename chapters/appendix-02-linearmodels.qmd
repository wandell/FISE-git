# Linear Models {#sec-linearmodels}

This should lean into the SVD, but also talk about Fourier representations.

It should also talk about overcomplete.

Maybe something about wavelets.  Pyramids.

Maybe something about Gabor representations for space-time efficiency.


I suppose there should also be something about Bayesian calculations, independence of parameters, that sort of thing.
