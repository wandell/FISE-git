# Pixels {#sec-sensors-circuits}

CMOS image sensors use photodiodes—and the photoelectric effect—to measure and store the optical light field at the sensor surface. The key technical breakthrough that enabled CMOS sensors was the invention of local circuitry to store and transmit the photon-generated electrons from the photodiode to the computer.

The photodiode and its associated circuitry are critical parts of the pixel, but there are other essential components as well (@fig-sensor-pixel-overview). For example, a small lens (microlens) is situated above each pixel, and a color filter passes certain wavelengths of light while blocking others. Integrated circuitry, including transistors and metal lines, manages the storage and transmission of charge.

Figure @fig-sensor-pixel-overview does not show every detail. Notice the gap between the photodiode and the color filter. In early CMOS imagers, this gap contained many metal lines that carried control and data signals. The metal lines were organized into layers (@fig-sensor-pixel-layers), and the distance from the microlens at the top to the photodiode at the bottom was fairly large compared to the size of the photodiode. In these early pixels, light from the main lens had to travel through what was effectively a tunnel to reach the photodiode.

![In color imagers, the color filters typically come in a pattern that is repeated across the sensor array.  A single pattern is called a super pixel. This image illustrates a super pixel for a sensor with cyan, magenta, and yellow color filters.  The metal lines are left in to emphasize that light from the main lens needed to pass through a tunnel to reach the photodiode.](images/sensors/03-pixel-overview2.png){#fig-sensor-pixel-layers}

Pixel architecture has evolved significantly over the years. Pixel sizes have shrunk, and the placement of the circuitry and metal lines has changed dramatically; light no longer passes through a deep tunnel. We will consider these improvements later in this section, but it is helpful to first understand the circuitry and key concepts behind the initial design.

## Circuitry
The logical flow of the circuitry is as follows:

-   Before image capture, the circuitry resets each pixel to clear any residual charge from previous exposures.
-   During image acquisition, the photodiode array collects electrons generated by incoming light; these electrons are stored within the photodiode or in a nearby capacitor.
-   During readout, the circuitry transfers the stored charge to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), where it is converted to a digital value.
-   The resulting digital image array records the amount of light captured by each pixel.

CMOS circuitry is the main focus of this section (@sec-sensors-circuits). Most CMOS image sensors also include essential components such as color filter arrays and microlenses, which redirect light from the main lens onto each photodiode within the pixel, and these components are introduced in @sec-sensors-components. Section @sec-sensors-characterization uses describes how to characterize and model sensor performance, from the scene light field to image capture.

### 3T circuits

![The original CMOS 3-transistor (3T) circuit design (@Fossum1997-early).](images/sensors/03-3T-circuit.png){#fig-sensor-3T-circuit}

The original CMOS pixel design uses a three-transistor (3T) circuit to store and read out the charge collected by the photodiode (@fig-sensor-fig-sensor-3T-circuit). Each pixel contains three key transistors: $M_{rst}$ (reset), $M_{sel}$ (select), and $M_{sf}$ (source follower). The $M_{rst}$ transistor resets the photodiode by connecting it to the supply voltage (Vdd), clearing any residual charge before image capture. The $M_{sel}$ transistor selects a specific row of pixels, connecting them to the readout circuitry. The $M_{sf}$ transistor acts as a buffer, transferring the stored charge to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for measurement. In most sensors, each column has its own ADC, but some designs use a single ADC shared among multiple columns—a technique known as multiplexing (mux).

Ideally, the photodiode’s response to light is linear, with the number of generated electrons following Poisson statistics. However, the surrounding circuitry introduces additional sources of noise and nonlinearity. For example, the storage capacitor has a limited capacity, so it can saturate at high light levels. The transistors used for readout can also introduce noise and small nonlinearities. Furthermore, variations in pixel properties across the sensor array can cause fixed-pattern noise. In modern CMOS sensors, these nonlinearities and noise sources are typically small—on the order of a few percent [@Wang2017-CMOSLinearity] -but they can still affect image quality. Careful characterization and calibration are necessary to minimize these effects and produce high-quality images.

### 4T circuits

![The 4T pixel circuit introduces a pinned photodiode and an additional transistor. When activated, the new transistor transfers the accumulated charge from the photodiode to a storage capacitor (the floating diffusion node, $C_{fd}$). The rest of the circuit, including readout and row select, is similar to the 3T design.](images/sensors/03-4T-circuit.png){#fig-sensor-4T-circuit}

Since about 2000, most CMOS image sensors have moved from the three-transistor (3T) pixel design to the four-transistor (4T) pixel circuit [@Fossum2014-pinnedpd]. The 4T pixel adds two important features: a pinned photodiode (PPD) and a transfer gate transistor (@fig-sensor-4T-circuit). The pinned photodiode improves charge storage and reduces noise, while the transfer gate allows precise movement of the collected charge from the photodiode to a storage node called the floating diffusion, which has a capacitance $C_{fd}$. The other circuit elements—reset, row select, and source follower—remain the same as in the 3T design.

The transfer gate and floating diffusion give the circuit better control over when and how charge is transferred and measured, which helps reduce noise and improve image quality.

Today, the 4T pixel is the standard in almost all high-performance CMOS image sensors, including those found in smartphones, industrial cameras, cars, and scientific instruments.

There is also Theuwissen diagram, with five transistors that he calls a 4T circuit.  In the paper 'Linearity analysis ...' @Wang2017-CMOSLinearity.  He says the source follower is shared by multiple rows of pixels. It is Figure 2.  

The text: "Figure 2 shows the schematic of a typical voltage mode 4T pixel. The pixel circuit consists of a pinned photodiode, a charge
transfer switch (M1), a reset switch (M2), a source follower (M3) and a row select switch (M4). The current source transistor (M5) is shared by multiple rows of pixels. VDD is the power supply while VPIX is the output voltage of pixel. VLN provides an adjustable bias current. In the following analysis, the nonlinearity caused by the row select transistor (M4) is omitted to simplify the analysis."

The 4T design offers several key advantages over the earlier 3T architecture. Most notably, it enables correlated double sampling (CDS), which significantly reduces reset noise (also known as $kTC$ noise). In the 4T pixel, the circuit first measures the voltage on the floating diffusion node before transferring charge from the photodiode (capturing a baseline), and then again after the charge is transferred. The difference between these two measurements represents the pixel signal. This subtraction cancels much of the noise introduced during the reset phase, improving signal-to-noise ratio.

Further improvements in materials and circuit architecture have led to even lower noise and higher quantum efficiency. Additional innovations, such as dual conversion gain and advanced pixel structures, have also expanded the dynamic range of CMOS sensors. We will explore some of these developments after reviewing the basic pixel circuit and other key sensor components.

## Circuit properties and parameters

Simulations of the CMOS circuitry can -and do- become very complex during the design phase. Engineers use specialized software that incorporates the foundry's design rules that account for material properties and feature sizes. This design software helps circuit designers achieve a working system from the foundry.

After the chip is built, it is impractical to characterize each different line, device and junction. Designers may place certain test circuits within the chip. But more generally systems are evaluated with respect to a set of objective measurements using images as input and digital values of output. This process is called called **system characterization** or **system calibration**. The characterization measurements specify the limitations of system performance, including light sensitivity, system noise, dynamic range, and color accuracy.

The characterization measurements are chosen to be practical and insightful about potential system errors. They are chosen to characterize key limitations based on knowledge of the circuit properties.

### Sensitivity: Fill factor

Because modern pixels are so small, each photodiode often collects only a modest number of photons—even under good lighting. For example, a $1~\mu\text{m}^2$ pixel in a dim scene (with a fast f/2 lens) might receive just 200 photons during an exposure. Photon arrivals follow Poisson statistics, so the standard deviation is $\sqrt{200} \approx 14$, or about 7% of the mean. This photon noise is a fundamental limit: it sets the minimum possible noise level and constrains the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in low-light conditions.

## Number of photons at each pixel
The number of photons arriving at a pixel depends on many factors, including the light intensity, the optics, and the size of the pixel. ISETCam is a useful tool for estimating quantities such as the number of incident photons. The variance in the number of photons at a $1~\mu\text{m}^2$ pixel under moderate to dim lighting is considerable. Here is an image calculated using ISETCam, showing the Poisson variation in the number of photons across a small region.

![Poisson noise in a uniform region of a dim scene. Each pixel is \$1\~\\mu\\text{m}\^2\$ and the scene intensity is 50 nits.](images/sensors/03-photonimage.png){#fig-photonimage width="60%"}.

This [ISETCam script](../code/fise_opticsCountingPhotons.html) illustrates the calculation. Nearly every sensor simulation we run in ISETCam includes calculations like this.
:::

The photodiode occupies only a portion of the pixel area; some of the pixel area is taken up by the circuitry. The proportion of the pixel area that is sensitive to light—the photodiode area—further limits light sensitivity. This proportion is called the **fill factor**. A higher fill factor means more of the pixel is used to detect light, increasing sensitivity. Fill factor is usually expressed as a value between 0 and 1, or as a percentage between 0% and 100%. The first-generation of CMOS image sensors were built with semiconductor technology with feature size on the order of 350 nm, and thus the circuitry might occupy as much as half of the pixel area (fill factor of 0.5). Over years the feature size has shrunk considerably and the fill factor of modern pixels can be greater than 0.9. The fill factor combined with the light sensitivity of the photodiode might result in about 150 electrons generated from the 200 photons. This number, too, is Poisson distributed so the short noise will be about $\sqrt{150} \approx 14$, about 8% of the mean.

### Well capacity and dynamic range
The photodiode and floating diffusion node in each pixel act as charge storage devices, often referred to as **storage wells**. The maximum number of electrons that can be stored in these wells is called the **well capacity** or **full-well capacity**. When the number of photo-generated electrons exceeds this capacity, any additional electrons cannot be stored, and the pixel output no longer increases with light intensity. Well capacity is therefore a key factor in determining the pixel’s dynamic range and the point at which it stops responding to additional light.

The **dynamic range** of a pixel is defined as the ratio between the largest and smallest amounts of light that can be reliably measured. Specifically, we measure the minimum detectable light level ($L_{min}$) and the maximum light level ($L_{max}$) that fills the well just below saturation. The dynamic range is then calculated as:

$$
\text{DR} = 20~\log_{10}\left(\frac{L_{max}}{L_{min}}\right)
$$

The logarithm compresses the range into more manageable numbers, typically between 60 and 100. The factor of 20 comes from conventions in audio engineering, where dynamic range is measured in decibels (dB). Image scientists use the same convention, so dynamic range is usually reported in dB.

### Response curve and nonlinearity

The finite well capacity can also have an impact on how the response increases with intensity. @fig-sensor-linearity shows an estimate of the number of stored electrons as a function of number of incident photons for a real sensor. The number of stored electrons increases linearly over a large part of the range. Beyond a certain level, as we approach the storage limit, the curve starts to saturate. As the light intensity increases even further, the curve completely flattens at the well capacity, in this example about 70,000 electrons.

![A CMOS sensor response curve, showing the number of electrons captured as function of the number of incident photons. From Figure 7 in that paper.](images/sensors/03-responselinearity.png){#fig-sensor-linearity width="60%"}

This pattern can be understood in terms of the physics. At low and moderate light levels, nearly all photo-generated electrons are successfully stored in the well. The photoelectric effect is linear and thus there is a linear increase in stored charge with increasing light intensity. 

As the well nears its full capacity, several effects cause the response to become sublinear and eventually saturate. First, when the storage well is almost full, some newly generated electrons cannot be stored and may leak out or recombine, reducing the efficiency of charge collection. Second, some electrons generated by photons may diffuse into neighboring regions of the sensor substrate rather than being stored in the intended circuit element (e.g., floating diffusion noise). Both leakage and diffusion become more significant at higher light intensities, causing the response curve to flatten out as it approaches saturation.

The exact onset and severity of this nonlinearity depend on the specific circuit design and material properties of the sensor. In certain designs the nonlinearity is negligible, with only  some degree of nonlinearity as the well capacity is approached. Understanding the response curve is important for accurately interpreting sensor measurements, especially in applications that require high dynamic range or precise quantitative imaging.

### Temporal noise

Reset noise. Readout noise.

### Dark current

### Fixed pattern noise

I don't want it called noise. It is really variation, not noise.

DSNU dark signal nonuniformity

PRNU photoresponse nonuniformity

Temperature dependence of circuit and sensor noise.

Temperature variations can also affect the linearity of the sensor. Changes in temperature can alter the behavior of the photodiode and the associated circuitry, leading to temperature-dependent nonlinearities. Modern sensors often include compensation mechanisms to mitigate these effects, but residual nonlinearities may still remain.

## Circuit innovations

Over time, as technology has scaled, more complex electrical circuitry has been placed on the sensor. Modern image sensors frequently include circuitry that performs local processing to increase the dynamic range of the sensor (well recycling), or to reduce the intrinsic noise (correlated double sampling). Some of this processing is *adaptive*, that is the circuit actions depend on the property of the input image. Consequently, the sensor output can depend upon both the control parameters set by the user and the image content.

### Global shutter

Instead of using a floating diffusion as a memory element, Aptina has utilized a surface-pinned storage node in the pixel to address dark current challenges. Available in its newest global shutter sensor, the MT9M031, the storage node also enables using a true correlated double sampling technique to reduce readout noise to four electrons, resulting in excellent low-light performance. The combination of the effective use of an anti-reflective metal light shield in close proximity to the memory node and careful doping and potential profile design results in a high GSE.\

### Dynamic range enhancement

Dynamic range extensions

Another source of nonlinearity arises from the photodiode itself. At high irradiance levels, the photodiode can saturate, meaning that it cannot generate additional electrons regardless of the incoming light. This saturation effect imposes a hard limit on the dynamic range of the sensor.

Understanding and modeling these nonlinearities is critical for applications that require high precision, such as scientific imaging or computational photography. Calibration techniques, such as measuring the sensor response under controlled conditions, can help correct for these nonlinearities in post-processing.
