### Vergence-Accommodation conflict (VAC)

Describe the principle here

### Timing mismatch here

Describe the principle here.

### Impacts on the viewer

1.  **Timing/Latency** (Motion-to-Photon Latency) $\rightarrow$ **Nausea & Dizziness** (Cybersickness)
2.  **Optics** (Vergence-Accommodation Conflict) $\rightarrow$ **Eye Strain & Headaches** (Visual Fatigue)

The rise of **Passthrough Mixed Reality** (like the Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest 3) made the timing mismatch more salient to people.  While standard VR latency is mostly "solved" for high-end hardware.  We can monitor the head and eye position and update within 20 ms.  

But *seeing the real world with a delay* (passthrough latency) is a new, highly sensitive frontier that has reignited the latency conversation. In this * mixed reality * mode the actual image has graphics superimposed.  Computing the graphical display can take time, and thus delay the image compared to the head movement.  This causes significant discomfort.

* **Symptoms:** Nausea, dizziness, vertigo, cold sweating, "stomach awareness."
* **The Mechanism:** This is a **Visual-Vestibular Conflict**. Your eyes see the world move (or lag behind your head movement), but your inner ear (vestibular system) says you moved instantly. The brain interprets this sensory mismatch as a hallucination or poisoning, triggering a nausea response to "expel the toxin."

* **Current Status:**
    * **In Standard VR:** Hardware latency is largely considered a "solved" engineering problem in high-end headsets. If the "motion-to-photon" latency is kept below **20ms** (the industry gold standard), most users do not feel sick from latency alone.
    * **In Mixed Reality (Passthrough):** This is where the problem has resurfaced. Even a 12ms delay in seeing your *own hands* or the *real room* moving can feel "wrong" and cause significant discomfort. This is likely why you are hearing people cite "timing" as the key problem again recently.

### The "Fatigue" Factor: VAC (Optical Mismatch)
* **Symptoms:** Eye strain, blurred vision, difficulty focusing after removing the headset, headaches, "heavy eyes."
* **The Mechanism:** This is the **Vergence-Accommodation Conflict (VAC)**.
    * **Vergence:** Your eyes rotate inward (cross) to look at a nearby virtual object.
    * **Accommodation:** Your eye lenses change shape to focus light.
    * In the real world, these two actions are coupled (you cross your eyes *and* focus close). In a headset, you must cross your eyes to see the 3D depth, but your lenses must stay focused at a fixed distance (usually ~1.5 to 2 meters) where the screen is optically projected. You are effectively "uncoupling" a reflex you've used since birth.
* **Current Status:** This is widely viewed as the **primary limiter of session duration**. It is why users often feel "drained" after 45–60 minutes, even if they don't feel nauseous. It is currently **unsolved** in most consumer hardware (which use fixed-focus lenses), though research into "varifocal" displays is ongoing.

### Summary of Relative Significance

| Feature | Primary Discomfort | "Consensus" Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Latency** | **Nausea (sickness)** | **The Gatekeeper.** If latency is bad, the device is unusable. It is the acute "show-stopper." |
| **VAC** | **Eye Strain (fatigue)** | **The Endurance Limiter.** It limits how *long* you can use the device comfortably, but rarely stops you immediately. |

**The Verdict:** If people are complaining about feeling *sick* or *dizzy*, the consensus points to **timing/latency** (or poor locomotion design). If they complain about *headaches* or *blurry vision* after a session, the consensus points to **VAC**.
