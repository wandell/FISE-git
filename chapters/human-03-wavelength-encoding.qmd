The material about human vision in this chapter is under development, and the text is not ready to be reviewed.

## Human wavelength encoding overview {#sec-human-wavelength-encoding-overview}

When you design a digital camera, how good does it need to be? The answer depends on who you're designing it for. If the images are for a human to look at, then the camera's design must be guided by the capabilities and limits of the human eye. This simple principle has profound consequences for engineering.

Vision scientists have learned a great deal about the first stages of vision. We have excellent measurements of how the eye's optics (the cornea and lens) transform light from the world into an image on the retina, and we know how the retina's photoreceptors encode that image into neural signals. This knowledge is not just academic; it's a practical guide for designing any system that reproduces images for people.

Consider color. A camera designed for human viewing should capture the same portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see: visible light. Capturing less of the spectrum would lead to poor color reproduction. Capturing more—like infrared or ultraviolet—would be wasteful, consuming resources to record information we can't see anyway. In this sense, human wavelength sensitivity sets a clear target for camera design.

Spatial resolution presents a different challenge. It would be a disappointment if a camera failed to capture details as fine as those the human eye can resolve. We expect our photos to be at least as sharp as what we see. However, unlike with color, people are often pleased if a camera captures a scene at a *finer* resolution than the eye can perceive. We can always zoom in on the digital image to see details we might have missed. This extra information doesn't interfere with the viewing experience; it just requires more storage and processing power.

So, we have two different engineering constraints derived from human vision:

*   **Wavelength:** Human vision sets a *target range*. Capturing more is wasteful.
*   **Spatial Resolution:** Human vision sets a *minimum bar*. Capturing more can be beneficial.

In this section, we will review the key properties of the eye that define these limits. The way our visual system samples space and encodes wavelength creates fundamental bottlenecks on what we can perceive. Understanding these limits doesn't explain everything about what we see, but it tells us what we *cannot* see—essential knowledge for the field of image systems engineering.

By Henry Brougham in Edinburgh Review, an ardent admirer of Newton, criticizing Thomas Young’s Bakerian Lectures.

>  ...this paper contains nothing which deserves the name, either of experiment or of discovery, and as it is, in fact, destitute of every species of merit. We now dismiss, for the present, the feeble lucubrations of this author, in which we have searched without success for some traces of learning, acuteness, and ingenuity, that might compensate his evident deficiency in the powers of solid thinking, calm and patient investigation … 

Thomas Young wrote a reply (@young1804-reply)

 > A MAN who has a proper regard for the dignity of his own character, although his sensibility may sometimes be awakened by the unjust attacks of interested malevolence, will esteem it ingeneral more advisable to bear, in silence, the temporary effects of a short lived injury, than to suffer his own pursuits to be interrupted, in making an effort to repel the invective, and to punish the aggressor.

## Retinal prostheses

Now that we know so much about the retinal encoding, the Palanker project would fit well.

THe Chichilnisky project gets thrown in at the end as next generation.  Palanker fits well with the cones going forward.  The Chichilnisky project fits well with motivating why we want to know what the retinal circuitry does so we address diseases when the bipolar cells (inner nuclear layer) are damaged.
