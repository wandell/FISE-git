# Sensor systems 

## Basic control systems

### Autofocus

Classic autofocus

Dual pixel autofocus

### Gain control and color
How do we prevent saturation?  Exposure control.  Gain.  ISO speed?

### Exposure control
Basic approach and surprising gain control artifact

#### Exposure bracketing

#### Burst photography
Google but others.  Multiple capture.

## Innovative sensor systems

### Lightfield cameras {#sec-sensor-lightfield}
Refocus.  Depth estimation

### Split pixel {#sec-sensor-splitpixel}
Autonomous driving.  HDR.

### Foveon {#sec-sensor-foveon}
Link back to physics.

### Spectral imagers {#sec-sensor-spectral}
Spectricity.  IMEC.
