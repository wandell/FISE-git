# Sensor systems
The range of light levels and and lighting conditions is quite large.  It is impossible to find a unique set of parameters - including focus, exposure, sensor gain - to acquire images that avoid saturation, excessive noise and proper focus. Sensors are integrated with control systems that aim to set these critical properties such as the exposure duration, aperture size, focus and signal gain. In computer vision applications, such as autonomous driving or robotics, these control systems are important guides for creating accurate quantitative sensor data.  In consumer photography, these systems help the user quickly find settings that will render an attractive image.

## Basic systems

Maybe this should be an additional chapter

Over time, as technology has scaled, more complex electrical circuitry has been placed on the sensor. Modern image sensors frequently include circuitry that performs local processing to increase the dynamic range of the sensor (well recycling), or to reduce the intrinsic noise (correlated double sampling). Some of this processing is *adaptive*, that is the circuit actions depend on the property of the input image. Consequently, the sensor output can depend upon both the control parameters set by the user and the image content.

### Global shutter {#sec-sensor-globalshutter}
Instead of using a floating diffusion as a memory element, Aptina has utilized a surface-pinned storage node in the pixel to address dark current challenges. Available in its newest global shutter sensor, the MT9M031, the storage node also enables using a true correlated double sampling technique to reduce readout noise to four electrons, resulting in excellent low-light performance. The combination of the effective use of an anti-reflective metal light shield in close proximity to the memory node and careful doping and potential profile design results in a high GSE.
