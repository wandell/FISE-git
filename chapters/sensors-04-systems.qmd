# Sensor systems
Sensor control systems are necessary to control critical properties such as the exposure duration, focus and sensor gain of the different color channels.  Illuminant correct is part of this, so hopefully we are ready for that by now.

The image of the purple Chicago sky could go here.

This is a description of the control systems.

## Basic control systems

### Autofocus

Classic autofocus

Dual pixel autofocus

Dual pixel autofocus could go here.


### Gain control and color
How do we prevent saturation?  Exposure control.  Gain.  ISO speed?

### Exposure control
Basic approach and surprising gain control artifact

#### Exposure bracketing

#### Burst photography
Google but others.  Multiple capture.

## Sensor innovations {#sec-sensor-innovations}

Maybe this should be an additional chapter

Over time, as technology has scaled, more complex electrical circuitry has been placed on the sensor. Modern image sensors frequently include circuitry that performs local processing to increase the dynamic range of the sensor (well recycling), or to reduce the intrinsic noise (correlated double sampling). Some of this processing is *adaptive*, that is the circuit actions depend on the property of the input image. Consequently, the sensor output can depend upon both the control parameters set by the user and the image content.

### Global shutter {#sec-sensor-globalshutter}
Instead of using a floating diffusion as a memory element, Aptina has utilized a surface-pinned storage node in the pixel to address dark current challenges. Available in its newest global shutter sensor, the MT9M031, the storage node also enables using a true correlated double sampling technique to reduce readout noise to four electrons, resulting in excellent low-light performance. The combination of the effective use of an anti-reflective metal light shield in close proximity to the memory node and careful doping and potential profile design results in a high GSE.

Illustrate rolling shuttter artifact.

Then say something about global shutter technology.
