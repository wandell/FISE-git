# Thick lens {#sec-optics-thicklens}

Rules of combination for focal length of multiple thin lenses

Introduce the idea that the second surface 'sees' the image that would have been formed by the first surface alone.

Jensen and White has good text on this. I will look for text from other sources, such as Goodman. But there are some simplifications that should be mentioned, including the two focal lengths and two nodal points. Propagation.

## ABCD ray transfer matrix {#sec-optics-abcd}

Maybe write a new ISETCam script with the ABCD implementation?

Leads nicely into the Ray Transfer Function concept returns to the optical light field in previous

## Ray transfer function

Use Ray Transfer images here in some way. Maybe introduce the metalens concept. Maybe even the spatial light modulator. They could go in a next section/chapter.

## Famous lenses

Maybe use isetlens to plot some of the lenses?

Double Gauss lens. Fish eye lens. Other examples such as below?

<!-- 
You're right, the Double Gauss is a classic! Here are some other famous lens designs often encountered in basic optics courses:

* **Cooke Triplet:** A three-element lens system known for its simplicity and good image quality. It's a foundational design that has been modified and adapted in many ways.
* **Tessar:** An evolution of the Cooke Triplet, adding a fourth element to improve performance and correct aberrations. 
* **Petzval Lens:** Historically significant, known for its large aperture but limited field of view. It's still used in some specialized applications. 
* **Biotar:** A fast lens design known for its distinctive rendering characteristics, often used in portrait photography.

These examples represent different approaches to lens design, balancing factors like image quality, size, cost, and complexity. 

Do any of these particularly interest you? I can try to provide more details about their specific features and historical significance.
