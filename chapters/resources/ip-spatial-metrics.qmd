# Spatial metrics - prepared by ChatGPT.

Prompt:  There are many image quality metrics based on the human visual system. I am collecting those in a separate project. Here I am interested in image quality metrics that are designed for cameras and display devices, not necessarily connected to human vision. As an example, the ISO 12233 standard, which measures the MTF using a slanted bar target, is not deeply connected to human vision. The PSNR metric is not connected to human vision. I am looking for other references. I know of a standard called 'Acutance'. Please create a list of such spatial image quality metrics.

| Metric / Standard | Category | Purpose | Notes / Comments |
|-------------------|----------|---------|------------------|
| **ISO 12233 Slanted-Edge MTF / SFR** | Resolution / Sharpness | Measures system MTF using the slanted-edge method (ESF → LSF → MTF) | Industry standard for camera/lens resolution testing. |
| **MTF50 / MTF30 / MTF10** | Resolution / Sharpness | Single-number sharpness metrics derived from the MTF curve | Common in Imatest, DxO, DPReview. |
| **Acutance (ISO 20462/Imatest)** | Resolution / Sharpness | Integrates MTF with a weighting to yield overall sharpness | Weighting often not based on vision; used as a device metric. |
| **Siemens Star Resolution** | Resolution | Radial resolution and asymmetry detection | Good for checking directional resolution limits. |
| **Line Pair Resolution (lp/mm)** | Resolution | Classical chart-based resolution measurement | Used in optical labs and film era; simple but widely used. |
| **Random Texture MTF (ISO 19567-2)** | Texture Preservation | Measures texture rendering in presence of noise reduction/demosaicing | “Dead-leaves” chart; used heavily by DxO. |
| **Texture Frequency Loss (TFL)** | Texture Preservation | Quantifies suppression of fine texture | Derived from random texture MTF. |
| **ISO 15739 Sharpness Metric** | Resolution / Texture | Sharpness in real scenes with noise present | Part of ISO imaging performance for DSC. |
| **Noise Power Spectrum (NPS)** | Noise | Frequency-dependent noise measurement | Standard for sensor evaluation in machine vision & medical imaging. |
| **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR, SNR(dB))** | Noise | Basic engineering noise metric | Device-centric, not perceptual. |
| **Fixed-Pattern Noise (FPN)** | Sensor Noise | Measures spatially fixed noise contributions | Includes DSNU (dark signal) and PRNU (photo-response). |
| **Photo-Response Nonuniformity (PRNU)** | Sensor Noise | Measures variance of pixel gain | Fundamental for CMOS/CCD characterization. |
| **Dark Signal Non-Uniformity (DSNU)** | Sensor Noise | Measures dark-current spatial variation | Temperature-dependent; sensor-level metric. |
| **Pixel Aperture / Sensor MTF** | Sensor Resolution | Analytic or measured MTF of sensor pixel structure | Includes optical blur + charge diffusion. |
| **Charge Diffusion Width / Spot Spread** | Sensor Blur | Spatial blurring caused within the photodiode | Used in CMOS/CCD modeling and sensor datasheets. |
| **Ringing / Overshoot / Undershoot Metrics** | Artifact Quantification | Measures artifacts from sharpening, deblurring, demosaicing | Extracted from the edge profile. |
| **Aliasing Energy (Spectral Folding)** | Artifacts | Measures energy above Nyquist that folds into lower frequencies | Used to evaluate sampling, CFA, & lens interactions. |
| **Demosaicing Artifact Metrics** | Artifacts | Quantifies false color or zippering | Often computed in Fourier domain or via local statistics. |
| **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** | Fidelity | Pixelwise distortion measure | Device-centric; widely used in compression and pipeline tests. |
| **MSE / RMSE** | Fidelity | Raw pixel error | No perceptual component. |
| **Linear Distortion Metrics (Gamma / Transfer Function)** | Linearity / Fidelity | Measures system response curve | Used in display and camera characterization. |
| **ISO 9241-305 Display MTF** | Display Resolution | Resolution of display measured with a camera | Standard for spatial performance of displays. |
| **Pixel Structure / Subpixel MTF** | Display / Sensor Resolution | MTF from subpixel arrangement (OLED, LCD, µLED) | Important for VR/AR and microdisplays. |
| **Display Uniformity Maps** | Display Uniformity | Spatial variation in luminance or contrast | Not HVS-based; purely physical uniformity metric. |
| **IEEE P1858 (CPIQ) Spatial Metrics (non-perceptual subset)** | Integrated System Metrics | Various device-centric spatial fidelity and texture metrics | Standardized test suite used by industry. |
| **Veiling Glare Index / Flare** | Optical Artifact | Measures stray-light performance (e.g., contrast loss) | Classical photographic metric. |
| **RMS Granularity (Film)** | Texture / Noise | Noise texture metric from film imaging | Included for completeness in imaging history. |
