# More lenses  {#sec-optics-morelenses}
The methods used to model thin lens properties (@sec-optics-geometric) can be further developed to explain more complex optics. This is not an optics text -and I am not an expert in optics- so I won't follow that path deeply here. But, I want you to know at least a little about those topics. In this section, I will describe how the ideas from thin lenses are used to characterize more complex optical systems, including a sequence of thin lenses and thick lenses. 

This is because I do want you to understand the notion of the ray transfer function (@sec-optics-raytransfer).  This is a general image systems engineering principle that applies to capture, display, and image understanding. We are heading there by building on the ideas of thin lenses and geometric optics.

## Multi-element lenses {#sec-optics-multielement}
In engineering, once we build one device the next move -as day follows night- is to ask what we can do if we put two, or many, of them together. Let's about the properties of putting multiple thin lenses together, an example of a **multi-element lens**.

Rules of combination for focal length of multiple thin lenses

Jensen and White has good text on this. I will look for text from other sources, such as Goodman. But there are some simplifications that should be mentioned, including the two focal lengths and two nodal points. Propagation.

## Thick lenses 


## ABCD ray transfer matrix {#sec-optics-abcd}

Maybe write a new ISETCam script with the ABCD implementation?

Leads nicely into the Ray Transfer Function concept returns to the optical light field in previous

## Ray transfer function {#sec-optics-raytransfer}

Use Ray Transfer images here in some way. Maybe introduce the metalens concept. Maybe even the spatial light modulator. They could go in a next section/chapter.

## Famous lenses {#sec-optics-lenses}

Maybe use isetlens to plot some of the lenses?

Double Gauss lens. Fish eye lens. Other examples such as below?

<!-- 
You're right, the Double Gauss is a classic! Here are some other famous lens designs often encountered in basic optics courses:

* **Cooke Triplet:** A three-element lens system known for its simplicity and good image quality. It's a foundational design that has been modified and adapted in many ways.
* **Tessar:** An evolution of the Cooke Triplet, adding a fourth element to improve performance and correct aberrations. 
* **Petzval Lens:** Historically significant, known for its large aperture but limited field of view. It's still used in some specialized applications. 
* **Biotar:** A fast lens design known for its distinctive rendering characteristics, often used in portrait photography.

These examples represent different approaches to lens design, balancing factors like image quality, size, cost, and complexity. 

Do any of these particularly interest you? I can try to provide more details about their specific features and historical significance.
