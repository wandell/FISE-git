## Image Systems Simulation Overview {#sec-isetcam-overview}

The important of simulations to drive innovations.

@sec-sensor-innovations

Mostly leads into the wiki page of ISETCam, but also talks about some of the other repositories of general interest.  Maybe ISET3d.  Maybe ISETBio.  Maybe ISETfluorescence.  Who knows.

## Lots of links

The video links but in a way that they are only maintained one place.  Maybe on SDR, maybe on GitHub.

Maybe YouTube?

## Internal examples from the book

Pointed to here.  Class projects?
