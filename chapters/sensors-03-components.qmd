In addition to the photodiode and underlying circuitry, CMOS image sensors incorporate several crucial optical components that play a vital role in capturing high-quality images. These elements -color filter arrays and microlens arrays- are engineered to enhance light collection and enable accurate color reproduction, making them essential for modern imaging performance.

To make a color image, sensors use a color filter array (CFA) placed above the photodiodes. Since a photodiode alone cannot distinguish between different wavelengths, the CFA ensures that each pixel is sensitive to a specific spectral band. The most common CFA pattern is the Bayer arrangement, which uses red, green, and blue filters distributed across the sensor. This allows the sensor to sample the visible spectrum at different locations, and the resulting data can be combined to reconstruct a full-color image. Some sensors use alternative filter patterns or additional spectral bands for specialized applications. Together, microlens arrays and color filter arrays are essential for the function and versatility of modern digital cameras.

The microlens array is a layer of tiny lenses placed above the color filter array. Each microlens is precisely positioned relative to the main lens, color filter, and photodiode. It serves to focus incoming light from the main lens onto the photodiode within the pixel. The microlens increases light-gathering efficiency, which is especially important as pixel sizes shrink. It also prevents cross-talk, a condition in which light passes at a large angle through a color filter and ends up generating electrons in a pixel that has a different color filter. Over time, microlens arrays have evolved to support additional functions, such as optimizing focus and enabling advanced imaging techniques like light field capture.
