That single channel metrics guy Barten
Based on your description, I'm quite confident you're thinking of **Peter G. J. Barten** and his work on image quality, particularly his **Square-root integral (SQRI)** model.

He fits your description perfectly:
* **Name:** "Barten" is very similar to your recollection of "Bartlett."
* **Field:** He was a highly influential display consultant and engineer who specialized in spatial image metrics and visual sensitivity.
* **Timeframe:** His key book, *"Contrast Sensitivity of the Human Eye and Its Effects on Image Quality,"* was published in 1999, and his SQRI model was widely discussed in the 1990s and 2000s, placing him exactly in the "about 20 years ago" period.
* **Model:** His work focused on luminance (black and white) and is famous for a single metric that predicts perceived image quality. This metric is precisely what you described: **a single integral**.

### The Barten Model and the "Square-root integral" (SQRI)

The simple formula you're remembering is likely the **Square-root integral (SQRI)**. This model calculates a single number (often called $J$) to represent the perceived quality of an image on a display.

The model is conceptually a single-channel integral across spatial frequencies. In simple terms, it does this:

1.  **It uses the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF):** Barten developed a comprehensive (though complex) set of equations to model the human eye's contrast sensitivity function ($CSF$), which is our ability to see fine detail (high spatial frequencies) versus coarse detail (low spatial frequencies). This is the "visual sensitivity model" part.
2.  **It Compares Display to Eye:** The SQRI formula integrates the ratio of the display's modulation transfer function ($MTF$, what the display can *show*) to the eye's modulation threshold ($M_t$, what the eye can *see*) at each spatial frequency.
3.  **The "One Integral":** The simplified form of the SQRI metric is an integral that looks conceptually like this:

    $$J \propto \int \sqrt{\frac{\text{Display Contrast}(f)}{\text{Human Threshold Contrast}(f)}} \, d(\log f)$$

This single number, $J$, is expressed in "Just Noticeable Differences" (JNDs) and provides a powerful metric for "how good" an image looks, which is exactly what he gave many seminars about.

Does Peter B. Barten and the Square-root integral model sound like what you were thinking of?

# Human visual metrics overview {#sec-human-metrics-overview}

Summary of what is to come.

## Spatial metrics

spatial MTF - Look through modern measurements of the spatial MTF.

ISO 12233

## Color representations 
James Clerk Maxwell's color matching experiments 
Color representations: XYZ, luminance, chromaticity, cones

## Color metrics

CIELAB

S-CIELAB

Mark Fairchild contributions. Others?

## Temporal metrics

temporal MTF metrics

## Image quality metrics {#sec-human-imagequality}

SSIM. Simpler ones. 

Pyramid from Beau? Multi-parameter

Erlier single channel.  Value of multiple channel metrics?  Existence?  S-CIELAB accounts for distance

SSIM and MS-SSIM

Sharpness metrics

I forget the guy with a B, I think

temporal MTF. Flicker.

Mantiuk

The surprising metric LPIPS

## Computer vision metrics for color?

They should be described elsewhere.

A lot of these might have been used in those directional cosine errors in Zheng's dissertation
