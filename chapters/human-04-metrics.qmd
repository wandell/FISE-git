That single channel metrics guy Barten
Based on your description, I'm quite confident you're thinking of **Peter G. J. Barten** and his work on image quality, particularly his **Square-root integral (SQRI)** model.

He fits your description perfectly:
* **Name:** "Barten" is very similar to your recollection of "Bartlett."
* **Field:** He was a highly influential display consultant and engineer who specialized in spatial image metrics and visual sensitivity.
* **Timeframe:** His key book, *"Contrast Sensitivity of the Human Eye and Its Effects on Image Quality,"* was published in 1999, and his SQRI model was widely discussed in the 1990s and 2000s, placing him exactly in the "about 20 years ago" period.
* **Model:** His work focused on luminance (black and white) and is famous for a single metric that predicts perceived image quality. This metric is precisely what you described: **a single integral**.

### The Barten Model and the "Square-root integral" (SQRI)

The simple formula you're remembering is likely the **Square-root integral (SQRI)**. This model calculates a single number (often called $J$) to represent the perceived quality of an image on a display.

The model is conceptually a single-channel integral across spatial frequencies. In simple terms, it does this:

1.  **It uses the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF):** Barten developed a comprehensive (though complex) set of equations to model the human eye's contrast sensitivity function ($CSF$), which is our ability to see fine detail (high spatial frequencies) versus coarse detail (low spatial frequencies). This is the "visual sensitivity model" part.
2.  **It Compares Display to Eye:** The SQRI formula integrates the ratio of the display's modulation transfer function ($MTF$, what the display can *show*) to the eye's modulation threshold ($M_t$, what the eye can *see*) at each spatial frequency.
3.  **The "One Integral":** The simplified form of the SQRI metric is an integral that looks conceptually like this:

    $$J \propto \int \sqrt{\frac{\text{Display Contrast}(f)}{\text{Human Threshold Contrast}(f)}} \, d(\log f)$$

This single number, $J$, is expressed in "Just Noticeable Differences" (JNDs) and provides a powerful metric for "how good" an image looks, which is exactly what he gave many seminars about.

Does Peter B. Barten and the Square-root integral model sound like what you were thinking of?

# Human visual metrics overview {#sec-human-metrics-overview}

Summary of what is to come.

## Image quality metrics {#sec-human-imagequality}

I have links to both original measurements, modern measurements (Standard Spatial Observer), and many commercial versions of spatial metrics that are implemented in ISETCam.  This section will describe those.

Material collected for incorporating here.  There are even some tables describing many of the metrics.  Helped from FISE-Human, I think.  Maybe Gemini, too, not sure.

### Classical

That single channel guy with his metric and formula.  Repeated everywhere. Barten.  SQRI.


Earlier single channel. Value of multiple channel metrics?  Existence?  S-CIELAB accounts for distance

SSIM and MS-SSIM

LPIP goes here because it is human judgments of image quality?

Pyramid from Beau? Multi-parameter



temporal MTF. Flicker.

I forked the [Mantiuk github repository: ](https://github.com/isetbio/stelaCSF) 
[The Mantiuk repository is here: ](https://github.com/gfxdisp/stelaCSF.git).
 His metric goes here, I think.  His code reads classic datasets.  Maybe we include the data files in the book? 

The surprising metric LPIPS

## Human color metrics

CIELAB

S-CIELAB

Mark Fairchild contributions. Others?

## Temporal metrics

temporal MTF metrics

## Computer vision metrics for color?

They should be described elsewhere.

A lot of these might have been used in those directional cosine errors in Zheng's dissertation
