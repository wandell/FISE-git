# Wavefront optics {#sec-optics-wavefront}
ISETCam uses wavefront representations.  Continuity.

Still shift invariant

Complex description of the PSF.  Why this rather than just the PSF?  

Model of plausible PSFs in this Zernike polynomial space is better.

## Wavefronts and images
Look for an explanation of why the wavefront at the lens is related to the image irradiance by a Fourier Transform.  Goodman?  ChatGPT?  Come on, it must be out there.

Lead up to wavefront in the next section.

## Wavefront aberrations
Zernike polynomials.

Explain the Zernike polynomials as an approximation to the wavefront.  Born and Wolf description of derivation might be good here.

## Apodization function 
Pupil shape can get introduced here.

## Example: Scratches and HDR rendering illustrated
