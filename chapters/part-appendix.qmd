# Part VII:  Appendix {#sec-part-appendix .unnumbered .unlisted}
{{< include "includes/WIP-callout.qmd" >}}

The appendices provide a more formal mathematical foundation for the concepts used throughout the book. They are designed as a reference for advanced undergraduate and graduate students who wish to deepen their understanding of the linear systems theory that underpins modern image systems engineering.

A summary of the topics that we will cover in the Sensors section of the book should be placed here. 

* General linear systems
* Shift invariant systems
* Software Examples

## Appendix topics

### General Linear Systems 

This appendix establishes the fundamental properties and mathematical representations of general linear systems.

*   Defines the core principles of linearity: superposition and scaling.
*   Introduces the matrix representation of a linear system, where the system's response is calculated through matrix-vector multiplication.
*   Explains the concept of representing signals (images) using different sets of **basis functions**, such as the point basis and harmonic basis.
*   Covers the properties of orthogonality and orthonormality, showing how they provide a simple method for calculating the basis function weights for any given signal.

### Shift-Invariant Systems 

This appendix specializes the discussion to the crucial subclass of linear shift-invariant (LSI) systems, which are widely used to model optics and other imaging components.

*   Defines shift-invariance and shows how it imposes a special **circulant structure** on the system matrix.
*   Introduces **convolution** as the fundamental operation of LSI systems in the spatial domain.
*   Establishes the most important property of LSI systems: that complex harmonics are their **eigenvectors**.
*   Introduces the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the practical tool for analyzing signals in terms of these harmonic eigenvectors.
*   Presents the **Convolution Theorem**, which states that computationally intensive convolution in the spatial domain is equivalent to simple multiplication in the frequency domain.

### Software Examples

*This appendix is planned, but not implemented.*

*It will provide practical software examples, likely using ISETCam and MATLAB/Python, to illustrate the key concepts from the main chapters. It will serve as a hands-on resource for simulating optical systems, sensor behavior, and image processing algorithms.*
