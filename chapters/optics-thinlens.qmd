# Thin lens formulae {#chapter-optics-thinlens}

The thin lens model is an important conceptual tool in optics. It provides a clear framework for understasnding key concepts like, focal length, magnification, and in general image formation. Moreover, practical systems are often made from components that include - or at least are well approximated by - a collection thin spherical lenses. We can describe these systems by understanding how multiple thin spherical lenses combine to form an optical system.

If the lens width is much smaller than the *radius of curvature* of its surfaces, it is called a *thin lens*.  The radius of the circle that (at least approximately) conforms to the surface of the lens is the radius of curvature. There is no universally agreed upon numerical value for what is meant by much smaller, but it is common to consider a lens whose width is one-tenth or less of the radius of curvature to be a thin lens.

![(a) This lens width is smaller than the radius of the circle that matches its surface. The lens might be considered thin. (b) This lens width is approximately equal to the radius of curvature. It is not be a thin lens.](../images/optics/thinlens-definition.png){#fig-thinlens-definition fig-align="center" width="60%"}

@fig-thinlens-focalpoints shows the important concept of the primary and secondary focal points of a convex and concave thin lens.  The primary focal point (F) is the location on the optical axis such that any ray coming from it towards the lens travels parallel to the axis after refraction. The distance from that point to the middle of the lens is called the *focal length*.  The secondary focal point The secondary focal point (F') is the axial point such that any incident ray traveling parallel to the axis will, after refraction, proceed toward, or appear to come from it.  The secondary focal point also has its own focal length. 

![(a) The primary (F) and secondary (F') focal points of a convex (left) and concave (right) thin lens. The solid lines show light rays. Read the diagram with the light rays (solid lines) traveling from left to right. The dashed lines drawn on the concave lens are virtual rays that are shown to clarify how the focal point is found. See the text for an explanation.](../images/optics/thinlens-focalpoints.png){#fig-thinlens-focalpoints fig-align="center" width="90%"}

Consider the convex lens on the left side of @fig-thinlens-focalpoints.  In the top we see that the rays emitted from F arrive at the lens and are refracted and exit parallel to the main axis.  On the left bottom the rays arrive in parallel and they are refracted towards the point F'.  

Now, look at the concave lens at the right @fig-thinlens-focalpoints.  The top right shows the primary focal point.  The incident rays that produce a collection of parallel rays exiting have a range of divergent angles. The dashed lines extending these incident rays, which converge at F, on the right of the lens. To calculate the secondary focal point, suppose the incident rays are parallel (bottom, right). These will diverge after refraction by the lens. We extend them with the dashed lines to see that they converge on the left side of the lens, at F'.

These thin lenses, like most of the examples in this book, are symmetric.  Thus, the two focal lengths are equal. The principles we introduce also apply even if the two surfaces differ, but we would have to pay more attention to the details and that would distract from the main idea.  To see those details, and many other ideas from optics, I commend the reader to some of the excellent textbooks on optics (References here.  Usually Goodman; Born and Wolf; I like Jenkins and White.)

The calculations implemented in ISETCam refer to all of these ideas. But the implementation is based on different principles, treating light as a wavefront, that we will describe later.  The calculations in graphics code of ISET3d refer to all of these ideas and are based on rays.
