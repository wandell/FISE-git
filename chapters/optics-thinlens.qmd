# Lens properties (thin lens) {#sec-optics-thinlens}
Many image system properties can be summarized by ray tracing. This analysis characterizes critical performance characteristics of an optical system, such as its focal length, magnification, and depth of field. These optical properties can be analyzed in a particularly simple and clear way if we consider very simple thin lenses.  This has some practical value as well because image systems are often made from lenses that are well approximated by a collection thin lenses. In some cases we can describe the whole system by calculating how multiple thin lenses combine to form the whole optical system. And in other cases, an entire image system can be characterized using these same concepts. 

Another reason to understand image systems by ray tracing is that many people, including most photographers, rely on these parameters when they describe optical system characteristics. Familiarity with these ray trace characterizations is important for anyone working in the field of image systems engineering.

The simplest way to introduce these ideas is to use a thin lens model.  We couple ray tracing methods with geometry and occasional linear algebra to derive certain performance characteristics. Ray tracing is not up to the task of a full simulation that calculates how the incident light field is transformed into optical light field. Such a calculation requires using linear system methods and accounting for the wave properties of light, for example to incorporate diffraction. We will explain the methods used for simulating the spectral irradiance at the sensor in subsequent chapters (@sec-optics-wavefront).  Here we introduce ways to understand the summaries of an image system that can be revealed by ray tracing.

If the lens width is much smaller than the *radius of curvature* of its two surfaces, it is called a *thin lens*.  The radius of the circle that (at least approximately) conforms to the surface of the lens is the radius of curvature. There is no universally agreed upon numerical value for what is meant by much smaller, but it is common to consider a lens whose width is one-tenth or less of the radius of curvature to be a thin lens.

The ISET3d calculations make use of all of the principles below and are based on rays. The ISETCam calculations make use of the principles below, as well. But the image formation calculation treats the lens as modifying the wavefront of the light. We describe this approach in [@sec-optics-wavefront].

## Focal points
@fig-thinlens-focalpoints shows the important concept of the primary and secondary focal points of a convex and concave thin lens.  The primary focal point (F) is the location on the optical axis such that any ray coming from it towards the lens travels parallel to the axis after refraction. The distance from that point to the middle of the lens is called the *focal length*.  The secondary focal point The secondary focal point (F') is the axial point such that any incident ray traveling parallel to the axis will, after refraction, proceed toward, or appear to come from it.  The secondary focal point has its own focal length. 

![(a) The primary (F) and secondary (F') focal points of a convex (left) and concave (right) thin lens. Read the diagram with the light rays (dark, solid lines) traveling from left to right. The dashed lines drawn on the concave lens are virtual rays that are shown to clarify how the focal point is found. See the text for an explanation.](../images/optics/thinlens-focalpoints.png){#fig-thinlens-focalpoints fig-align="center" width="100%"}

Consider the convex lens on the left side of @fig-thinlens-focalpoints.  In the top we see that the rays emitted from F arrive at the lens and are refracted and exit parallel to the main axis.  On the left bottom the rays arrive in parallel and they are refracted towards the point F'.  

Now, look at the concave lens at the right @fig-thinlens-focalpoints.  The top right shows the primary focal point.  The incident rays that produce a collection of parallel rays exiting have a range of angles. The dashed lines extending these incident rays, which converge at F, on the right of the lens. To calculate the secondary focal point, we examine the case when the incident rays are parallel (bottom, right). They will diverge after refraction by the lens. We extend them backwards (dashed lines) to see that they would appear to converge on the left side of the lens, at F'.

![Different radii of curvature for a thin lens.](../images/optics/thinlens-asymmetric.png){#fig-thinlens-asymmetric fig-align="center" width="100%"}

The lenses drawn in @fig-thinlens-focalpoints are symmetric. Thus, the two focal lengths are equal. The principles we introduce would apply even if the two surfaces of the lens differ, but we would have to pay more attention to the details and that would distract from the main ideas. To see those details, and many other ideas from optics, I commend the reader to some of the excellent textbooks on optics (References here.  Usually Goodman; Born and Wolf; I like Jenkins and White.)



## Three ray trace principles 

Consider the vector object on the left of @fig-lensmaker-center.  A ray from the arrowhead that is parallel to the axis will be refracted through the focal point. A ray from origin of the vector, which is on the optical axis, will also pass through the focal point.  Finally, a ray from the arrowhead - and this is new - that passes through the center of the lens will continue on a straight path.

![Tracing an object through the lens to an image.](../images/optics/lensmaker-center.png){#fig-lensmaker-center fig-align="center" width="70%"}

In summary, rays that
* Enter parallel to the optical axis and pass through the focal point on the opposite side.
* Pass through the center of the lens do not deviate (refract).
* Pass through the primary focal point toward the lens exit parallel to the optical axis.
  
   
## Focal plane
They rays from a distant point off the optical approach the entrance as parallel to one another but oblique to the optical axis.  The ray that passes through the center of the lens is called the *chief ray*.  There will also be a ray that passes through the primary focal point.  It will be refracted by the lens and emerge as parallel to the optical axis.  These two rays intersect where the image of the point will be formed.

## Lens power (diopters)
The *power* of a lens is the inverse of the focal length, in meters.  The unit for lens power, $1/m$ is the *diopter*.  A short focal length implies large power, either due to the curvature of the lens surface or the refractive index of the lens material. 

![Lens power is the inverse of focal length.  The unit of lens power is diopter.](../images/optics/lensparameters-power.png){#fig-thinlens-power fig-align="center" width="80%"}

To measure the focal length of a lens we use a light source that produces parallel rays at the entrance aperture of the lens. We then slide the image plane back and forth, searching for the distance where the spot is smallest.  We can create parallel rays using many methods. Perhaps the simplest is to use a small point source (e.g., an LED) at a distance from the lens. The rays arriving at the lens will be a small angular sliver of the emitted rays, and if the source is far from the lens the rays will be very close to parallel (e.g., @fig-pinhole-basic).  An alternative, is to go outside on a sunny day and use the sun as a source.  The sun isn't small, but it is really far away.  By the time the rays from the disk of the sun arrive at your lens, the rays will be parallel.

The optics in the human eye has multiple elements.  Even so, we can measure its focal length, which is about 0.016 m (~60 diopters). To bring objects at different distances into focus the optics adjusts its power, a process called *accommodation*.  If it cannot adjust adequately, we wear lenses (glasses, contact lenses) that increase or decrease the optical power, say by 1-8 diopters, so that a good image can be focused on the retina.  

Young people can accommodate easily. As people age, we lose the ability to change the optical power of the optics, a condition called *presbyopia*.  This happens to everyone. This biological fact is a consideration for the design of near field displays (@sec-displays).

## F number
The "F number" (f/#) of a thin lens is the ratio of its focal length and entrance aperture diameter (@fig-fnumber).  For example, when we write f/4, it means that the focal length is 4x the aperture diameter.

![Graphic of the f/#.](../images/optics/lensparameters-fnumber.png){#fig-fnumber fig-align="center" width="50%"}

The f/# is an important parameter for all thin lenses, and it appears in many formulae. It is the only free parameter of a circular, diffraction-limited thin lens.  For example, the Airy disk diameter (meters) on the focal plane of a diffraction limited lens depends only on the wavelength of light and the f/# of the lens.  If the wavelength is $\lambda$ and f/# is $F$, the formula for the Airy Disk diameter is

$$ d = 2.44 ~ \lambda ~ F$$ {#eq-airy2}

If you revisit the first calculation of the Airy Disk, in @sec-lightfields-diffraction, you will see that this formula is implicit in how we modeled the image from a diffraction limited pinhole [@eq-airy1].

## Thin lens equation

When an object is far away, the rays arriving at the lens are parallel.  The image of the object will be in focus at the focal length. When the object is closer, we can use the *Lensmaker's equation* to find the plane where the object will be in focus. The equation, which was derived by Halley in 1693, relies on three properties of symmetric thin lenses.

From these facts, we can locate where the object at a distance $d_o$ will be in focused on the image side; call that distance $d_i$.  Notice that the image is inverted.

The rays drawn in the image form two pairs of similar triangles that we can use to draw some inferences about the relationship between $f$, $d_o$ and $d_i$.
