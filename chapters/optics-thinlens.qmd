The thin lens is an extremely important conceptual tool in optics. The thin lens model provides a very clear framework for learning key concepts like, focal length, magnification, and in general image formation. Moreover, practical systems are often made from components that are well approximated as thin lenses. We can describe these systems by understading how multiple lenses work together in systems.

Add in the radius of curvature definition of thin lens from the class slides.

Define the F-number and its importance for thin lenses. Why it is the single, key parameter.

Lensmakerâ€™s equation derivation which is from Gauss and I think I teach as Psych 221 slides.

Graph of focal distance to image plane as a function of object distance.  Notice that the object focal plane approaches a constant and stays near that level for a very large distance range.

This is connected to f-number and to radiometry.  Maybe not here? Question of distance trading off with magnification for constant intensity per unit area with distance to the wall.

Magnification and Zoom. Depth of field formula. The sequence from class slides.
