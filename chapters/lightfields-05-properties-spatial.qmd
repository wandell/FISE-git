## Spatial regularities overview {#sec-spatial-regularities-overview}

We can immediately recognize whether an image is natural or not.  Example of, say, random noise, line drawing, natural image.

Why? 

The set of natural images has a spatial statistical characterization. Knowing how to quantify whether an image is likely to be a natural image -or not- has been a longstanding goal of image systems engineering and vision science.  The reason is simple:  the more wew know about the range of possible inputs, the better we will do at making inferences about the objects in the scene (@sec-image-regularities).

## Spatial correlations and fractals {#sec-fractals}

The scale invariance of natural images arises from their power-law spectral decay, which mathematically ensures statistical consistency across spatial scales. The connection between 1/f\^α spectra and scale invariance can be expressed through:

The power spectrum of natural images follows:

$$
P(\omega) \propto \frac{1}{|\omega|^{2-\eta}} \quad \text{where } \eta \approx 0.8\text{--}1.5
$$

Here, $\omega$ represents spatial frequency magnitude, and $\eta$ controls the decay rate[^lightfields-properties-3],[^lightfields-properties-4],[^lightfields-properties-5].

[^lightfields-properties-5]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042698996000028

For scale invariance under spatial scaling $x \to \lambda x$, the power spectrum must satisfy:

$$
P(\lambda\omega) = \lambda^{-\kappa}P(\omega)
$$

Substituting the power-law form:

$$
P(\lambda\omega) = \frac{1}{|\lambda\omega|^{2-\eta}} = \lambda^{-(2-\eta)}P(\omega)
$$

This matches the scale-invariance condition with $\kappa = 2-\eta$, demonstrating that statistical properties remain consistent across scales[^lightfields-properties-6],[^lightfields-properties-7],[^lightfields-properties-8].

**Fractal connection** The power-law exponent relates to fractal dimension $D$ through:

$$
D = 3 - \frac{\eta}{2}
$$

where $D$ quantifies space-filling characteristics. Natural images typically exhibit $D \approx 2.2\text{--}2.6$, consistent with their 1/f\^α spectra[^lightfields-properties-9],[^lightfields-properties-10].

This mathematical framework shows that 1/f\^α spectra inherently encode fractal, scale-invariant structure - the same statistical regularities appear whether analyzing fine details or coarse features of natural scenes[^lightfields-properties-11],[^lightfields-properties-12],[^lightfields-properties-13].
