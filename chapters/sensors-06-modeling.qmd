# System modeling {#sensor-system-modeling}

Standard sensor designs are effective for many uses, which is why they are produced in large quantities. However, they have limitations: color filters can reduce sensitivity and restrict spectral information, while circuit elements can introduce noise or limit dynamic range and speed. These challenges have driven innovations in sensor and pixel design, especially for applications beyond traditional photography. Later sections will explore advanced pixel architectures, new materials, and on-chip processing techniques that address these issues. As this book is online, sections about these advances can be updated as new technologies emerge as well as links to additional resources.
