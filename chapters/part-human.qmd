# Part IV:  Human Vision {#sec-human .unlisted .unnumbered}
{{< include "includes/WIP-callout.qmd" >}}

The material about human vision in this volume is currently under development.

For now, please refer to the chapters in [Foundations of Vision](https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu){target=_blank}. 

- [Wavelength encoding](https://wandell.github.io/FOV-1995/chapter-4-wavelength-encoding.html){target=_blank}
- [Pattern sensitivity](https://wandell.github.io/FOV-1995/chapter-7-pattern-sensitivity.html){target=_blank}
- [Multiresolution representations](https://wandell.github.io/FOV-1995/chapter-8-multiresolution-image-representations.html){target=_blank}
- [Color appearance](https://wandell.github.io/FOV-1995/chapter-9-color.html){target=_blank}

The new material in this volume will emphasize the human vision engineering standards, reducing the emphasis on biology that is part of FOV.

## Human topics {#sec-human-topics}

* Human optics measurements
* Color representations
* Metrics for color
* Metrics for space-time
