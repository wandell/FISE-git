## Harmonic characterization overview
There are many reasons why people would like to describe the quality of an optical system.  Commercial vendors that sell parts may need to specify the quality and the tolerance of the quality measure.  We may want to optimize the properties of a design, using the image quality measure as a metric for the optimization.  We may wish to simulate the system and learn which signals are preserved by the optics and which are lost to image quality.
