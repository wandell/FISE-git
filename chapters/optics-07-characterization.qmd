# Harmonic characterization

## Haromnic characterization overview
The point spread function is a very natural way to understand the performance of the optical system.  The idea of using a point stimulus and seeing how it spreads out in the image is very intuitive.  It also has some complexity and challenges for quantification. How do we quantify the shape of the point spread function for any but the simplest cases (Airy pattern)?  There are some simple point spread shapes with a small number of parameters that are useful for simulation (@sec-pointspread-common), but these approximations are not sufficient for many common commercial systems or ophthalmological measurements of the human eye.

Harmonic functions offer an excellent alternative, and there is a clear reason for this. When a harmonic function at spatial frequency $f$ is input to an optical system, over any isoplanatic region the image is also a harmonic function at the same frequency.  The image will have  section explains a couple of reasons why harmonics are a really important set of basis functions. Some have to do with physics and reality.  Some have to do with mathematics.

Harmonics (like sine and cosine waves) are almost the “natural” patterns for linear systems—they’re close to being eigenfunctions. For imaging, they’re not quite perfect eigenfunctions because of phase shifts, but if you think of them as 2D vectors, they’re pretty close.
