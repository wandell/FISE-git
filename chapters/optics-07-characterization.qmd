# Harmonic characterization {#sec-optics-characterization}

## Harmonic characterization overview
There are many reasons why people would like to describe the quality of an optical system.  Commercial vendors that sell parts may need to specify the quality and the tolerance of the quality measure.  We may want to optimize the properties of a design, using the image quality measure as a metric for the optimization.  We may wish to simulate the system and learn which signals are preserved by the optics and which are lost to image quality.

The point spread function is a very intuitive way to understand the performance of the optical system. But, it is not a great general tool to quantify image quality. We can quantify the shape of the point spread function for the simplest cases (Airy pattern). And there are some simple point spread shapes with a small number of parameters that are useful for simulation (@sec-pointspread-common). But these instances are not sufficient to approximate many real lenses, multielement lenses, or measurements of the human eye.

Harmonic functions are a tool to help with system characterization. Their value arises from this simple and important fact:  When the input to an optical system is a harmonic function at spatial frequency $f$ and unit contrast, in each local region the image will also be a harmonic function at the same frequency.  The relative phase and amplitude of the output will differ from the input, but we only need to measure these two parameters.  

This chapter explains the general principle and then provides several ways in which harmonics are used to characterize optical systems as well as the human visual system.

## System eigenfunctions

We say that the harmonics are almost **eigenfunctions** of shift-invariant linear systems. An eigenfunction of a system is an input that passes through the system unchanged apart from a scale factor.  Harmonics are not perfect eigenfunctions because in addition to the amplitude scaling, there can be a phase shift. But theyâ€™re pretty close and for that reason quite useful.
