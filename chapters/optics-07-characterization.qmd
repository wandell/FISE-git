# Harmonic characterization {#sec-optics-characterization}

## Harmonic characterization overview
There are many reasons why people would like to describe the quality of an optical system.  Commercial vendors that sell parts may need to specify the quality and the tolerance of the quality measure.  We may want to optimize the properties of a design, using the image quality measure as a metric for the optimization.  We may wish to simulate the system and learn which signals are preserved by the optics and which are lost to image quality.

If the point spread function can be quantified using a few parameters, such as the Airy Pattern, it can be helpful in system characterization.  But more often than not, the point spread function is an image that has not natural parameterization to quantify system performance.

The harmonic functions, on the other hand, have a natural set of parameters, and the different frequencies and orientations have a simple intuitive interpretation.  This has led to their widespread use in image quality characterization.

## Limitations

Say stuff about how they apply to isoplanatic regions (shift-invariant) but not to the image as a whole. 

The point spread depends on parameters such as the pupil aperture, which often changes as people adjust for light level.  Hence, it is not always possible to have a unique point spread for a point.

It is tough, by the way, to have depth dependent point spreads and to interpolate between point spreads.

What else?
