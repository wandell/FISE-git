## Eigenfunctions - almost
This section explains a couple of reasons why harmonics are a really important set of basis functions. Some have to do with physics and reality.  Some have to do with mathematics.

Harmonics (like sine and cosine waves) are almost the “natural” patterns for linear systems—they’re close to being eigenfunctions. For imaging, they’re not quite perfect eigenfunctions because of phase shifts, but if you think of them as 2D vectors, they’re pretty close.
